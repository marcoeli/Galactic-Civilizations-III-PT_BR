    <Label>EXP4_M1_Terran_StartupDescription</Label>
    <String>D.L. Bradley has returned from the pocket universe and freed Earth. But the war has only just begun. Bradley, with the terrible power of the Bane at his command, has begun a crusade that will only end when the Drengin Empire has been completely wiped from the galaxy.

But the mysterious Thalan Contingency has come forward with a chilling prophecy: this crusade will result in the utter destruction of the galaxy. Despite this warning, Bradley has begun to make his strike into the heart of the Drengin Empire.</String>

  <StringTable>
    <Label>EXP4_M1_Terran_StartupTraitsDescription</Label>
    <String>The Thalan claim that proof of the upcoming Apocalypse can be found on an ancient Precursor prison world. What this proof is exactly, they weren't clear but it deserves further investigation.

D.L. Bradley has dispatched a small fleet to this out-of-the-way sector to investigate the Thalan's claims, while he continues into Drengin territory.</String>

    <String>The appearance of the Last Dreadlord on Yiven III has brought Colonel Casey to Altaria, also known as the ancient world of Elemental. Once there she has to find the last Shard of the Telenanth and bring it to D.L. Bradley or all is lost. Unfortunately, the Yor have captured Altaria and fortified the surrounding space with special hyperdrive disrupting starbases. This will make a fast retrieval of the Shard difficult, if not impossible. 

Colonel Casey must fight her way through the Yor fortifications and secure the last Shard before D.L. Bradley reaches the heart of Drengin Territory and seals the fate of the galaxy.</String>

    <String>Colonel Jenna Casey has fought her way into the heart of the Drengin Empire to bring the Shard of the Telenanth to D.L. Bradley. However, Drengi and the devestating firepower of the Drengin armada stands between her and the First Fleet.
