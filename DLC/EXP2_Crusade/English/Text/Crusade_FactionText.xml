    <String>For over a decade Earth was locked behind the Precursor Shield. Their foes thought them beaten. They were wrong. In their solitude, mankind found a new purpose, united behind a single goal: the destruction of the Drengin Empire. 

With the return of D.L. Bradley and the T.A.S. Crusader, Earth was finally able to escape the confines of the Precursor Shield. And now it's ready to retake its place in the galaxy.</String>

    <String>Furious at the insubordination and humanity's rejection of the path he laid out for them, D.L. Bradley has taken his great vessel, the Crusader, and gone to search for more power. Jenna Casey and the combined Terran fleet must now confront the Drengin on their own.

Lacking the Crusader's incredible power, will they be able to turn back the Drengin theat, and finally buy some measure of peace for humanity?</String>

    <String>Drengin soldiers are savagely effective at ground-based combat, and their naval vessels are famously tough. Their military manufacturing ability is also impressive, but Drengin colonies do sometimes struggle with discontent. Much of their famous inventiveness is put into stopping slaveling revolts.</String>
