			<Text>It's good to see {PLAYERFACTIONLONG:1}'s soldiers on parade, with their smart uniforms.</Text>

			<Requirements>
				<ListenerGovernment>Plutocracy</ListenerGovernment>

			<Requirements>
				<ListenerGovernment>Republic</ListenerGovernment>

		<FlavorTextOption>
			<Requirements>
				<ListenerGovernment>Objectivism</ListenerGovernment>
			</Requirements>

		</FlavorTextOption>

		<FlavorTextOption>
			<Requirements>
				<ListenerGovernment>Aristocracy</ListenerGovernment>

		</FlavorTextOption>

		<FlavorTextOption>
			<Requirements>
				<ListenerGovernment>Singularity</ListenerGovernment>
			</Requirements>
			<Text>{LEADERNAME:1} has done a great job managing {PLANETNAME:1}. Whatever their nature, they know how we like to live.</Text>
		</FlavorTextOption>

		<FlavorTextOption>
			<Requirements>
				<ListenerGovernment>Federation</ListenerGovernment>
			</Requirements>

				<ListenerGovernment>Scientific</ListenerGovernment>

		<InternalName>WORDONTHESTREET_GOVERNMENT_MIDMORALE</InternalName>
		<FlavorTextOption>
			<Text>Just between you and me, I don't know about {LEADERNAME:1}. They keep making promises they can't keep.</Text>
			<Text>I trust {LEADERNAME:1}. I hope they're strong enough to keep our government together.</Text>
			<Text>{PLANETNAME:1} is grossly underequipped. It often feels like the rest of {PLAYERFACTIONLONG:1} is passing us by.</Text>
			<Text>Everything is going fairly well. Not perfectly. But anyone who expects things to be perfect isn't being realistic.</Text>
			<Text>Things have turned around a bit. But {LEADERNAME:1} shouldn't relax yet. There's still room for improvement.</Text>

		<FlavorTextOption>
			<Requirements>
				<ListenerGovernment>Coalition</ListenerGovernment>

		</FlavorTextOption>

		<FlavorTextOption>
			<Requirements>
				<ListenerGovernment>Colonial</ListenerGovernment>
			</Requirements>
			<Text>The problem with all this focus on colonization is that they think you're just a number. There are real lives being shuffled around!</Text>
		</FlavorTextOption>

		<FlavorTextOption>
			<Requirements>
				<ListenerGovernment>EmergencyCoalition</ListenerGovernment>
			</Requirements>
			<Text>I've heard {LEADERNAME:1} doesn't have to put up with these restrictions placed on us regular citizens. Emergency, my rear.</Text>

		<FlavorTextOption>
			<Requirements>
				<ListenerGovernment>Communion</ListenerGovernment>
			</Requirements>
			<Text>My cousin said that they have way more public facilities on {PLANETNAME:1} than we do here. Is that true? Is that allowed?</Text>
		</FlavorTextOption>

		<FlavorTextOption>
			<Requirements>
				<ListenerGovernment>Empire</ListenerGovernment>
			</Requirements>
			<Text>{LEADERNAME:1} promises much and delivers little. Do they think we can take the galaxy like this?</Text>

			<Requirements>
				<ListenerGovernment>Kingdom</ListenerGovernment>
			</Requirements>
			<Text>Are we planning to conquer another system? I wonder if one day we should just settle for what we have.</Text>

			<Requirements>
				<ListenerGovernment>Imperial</ListenerGovernment>

			<Requirements>
				<ListenerGovernment>Jihad</ListenerGovernment>

			<Requirements>
				<ListenerGovernment>Plutocracy</ListenerGovernment>
			</Requirements>
			<Text>I just bought a mark 3020, and the 3021 is already out. I don't want to buy it, but how can I not?</Text>
		</FlavorTextOption>

		<FlavorTextOption>
			<Requirements>
				<ListenerGovernment>Republic</ListenerGovernment>
			</Requirements>
			<Text>I know it's not too popular a thing to say, but I think {LEADERNAME:1}'s government is basically doing an okay job.</Text>
		</FlavorTextOption>

		<FlavorTextOption>
			<Requirements>
				<ListenerGovernment>Objectivism</ListenerGovernment>
			</Requirements>
			<Text>My business hasn't been doing so well lately. Something's not right. I bet someone's leaching from {PLANETNAME:1}'s colonial government.</Text>
		</FlavorTextOption>

		<FlavorTextOption>
			<Requirements>
				<ListenerGovernment>Aristocracy</ListenerGovernment>
			</Requirements>
			<Text>{LEADERNAME:1} is conducting a poll? Right. They only listen to the local nobility. And the local nobility sure doesn't listen to us.</Text>
		</FlavorTextOption>

		<FlavorTextOption>
			<Requirements>
				<ListenerGovernment>Singularity</ListenerGovernment>
			</Requirements>
			<Text>It's weird how {LEADERNAME:1} knows what we want before we do. Not bad. Just weird.</Text>
		</FlavorTextOption>

		<FlavorTextOption>
			<Requirements>
				<ListenerGovernment>Federation</ListenerGovernment>
			</Requirements>
			<Text>Whatever threats {PLAYERFACTIONLONG:1} faces, we must never compromise our core principals. I'm worried that commitment has been slipping lately.</Text>
		</FlavorTextOption>

		<FlavorTextOption>
			<Requirements>
				<ListenerGovernment>Monarchy</ListenerGovernment>
			</Requirements>
			<Text>{LEADERNAME:1} got us this far. Let's hold off the revolutionary talk and trust them to get us a bit further yet.</Text>
		</FlavorTextOption>

		<FlavorTextOption>
			<Requirements>
				<ListenerGovernment>Scientific</ListenerGovernment>
			</Requirements>
			<Text>We need more universities on {PLANETNAME:1}. Our children are destined to be second class citizens without them.</Text>
		</FlavorTextOption>

		<FlavorTextOption>
			<Requirements>
				<ListenerGovernment>Theocracy</ListenerGovernment>
			</Requirements>
			<Text>Between you and me, my brothers and sisters here are a bit less devout than they were on my homeworld. The prelates let them get away with too much!</Text>
		</FlavorTextOption>

		<FlavorTextOption>
			<Requirements>
				<ListenerGovernment>Unity</ListenerGovernment>
			</Requirements>
			<Text>Unity has struggled lately. Unity can see this. Unity knows it must do better.</Text>

				<ListenerGovernment>Utopian</ListenerGovernment>

			<Text>I support {LEADERNAME:1}, but I feel like I'm the only one.</Text>
			<Text>{PLANETNAME:1} is a disaster! Our government is focused on the wrong priorities. Whose fault is this?</Text>
			<Text>{PLANETNAME:1} is hideous. I think we should name it after {LEADERNAME:1}.</Text>
			<Text>Things aren't going well in {PLAYERFACTIONLONG:1}. And I'm not the only one who thinks it!</Text>
			<Text>These endless mishaps and disasters have been going on too long. Someone needs to stop this.</Text>
		</FlavorTextOption>

		<FlavorTextOption>
			<Requirements>
				<ListenerGovernment>Coalition</ListenerGovernment>
			</Requirements>
			<Text>{PLAYERFACTIONLONG:1} is dysfunctional. This coalition won't last long, and then where will we be?</Text>

		<FlavorTextOption>
			<Requirements>
				<ListenerGovernment>Colonial</ListenerGovernment>
			</Requirements>
			<Text>I've had it with the makeshift facilities, and the attacks by wild beasts, and the strange, tasteless food. I'm sick of the frontier life.</Text>
		</FlavorTextOption>

		<FlavorTextOption>
			<Requirements>
				<ListenerGovernment>EmergencyCoalition</ListenerGovernment>
			</Requirements>
			<Text>How long can an emergency go on for? {PLANETNAME:1} feels more and more tense every day. I'm worried someone's going to snap.</Text>
		</FlavorTextOption>

		<FlavorTextOption>
			<Requirements>
				<ListenerGovernment>Communion</ListenerGovernment>
			</Requirements>
			<Text>My neighbors aren't contributing as much as they can to the local cooperative. We need more anonymous reporting measures.</Text>

		<FlavorTextOption>
			<Requirements>
				<ListenerGovernment>Empire</ListenerGovernment>
			</Requirements>
			<Text>{LEADERNAME:1} is a monster. Wait. Are you writing this down? No, stop!</Text>

		<FlavorTextOption>
			<Requirements>
				<ListenerGovernment>Kingdom</ListenerGovernment>
			</Requirements>
			<Text>I've lived on {PLANETNAME:1} my whole life, and look how little I have to show for it. Everything I make goes to the landowners. What about me?</Text>
		</FlavorTextOption>

		<FlavorTextOption>
			<Requirements>
				<ListenerGovernment>Imperial</ListenerGovernment>
			</Requirements>
			<Text>Every planet in the galaxy is better than {PLANETNAME:1}. It's a good thing we'll conquer them all. Because I want off this one.</Text>
		</FlavorTextOption>

		<FlavorTextOption>
			<Requirements>
				<ListenerGovernment>Jihad</ListenerGovernment>
			</Requirements>
			<Text>{LEADERNAME:1} needs to focus less on our enemies and more on building things. {PLANETNAME:1} is a shambles.</Text>
		</FlavorTextOption>

		<FlavorTextOption>
			<Requirements>
				<ListenerGovernment>Oligarchy</ListenerGovernment>
			</Requirements>
			<Text>I would tell you what I really thought, but you wouldn't print it.</Text>

		<FlavorTextOption>
			<Requirements>
				<ListenerGovernment>Plutocracy</ListenerGovernment>
			</Requirements>
			<Text>When I complained about all the people dying in the slums they tried to sell me a life insurance policy. I bought it, but still it seems wrong.</Text>
		</FlavorTextOption>

		<FlavorTextOption>
			<Requirements>
				<ListenerGovernment>Republic</ListenerGovernment>
			</Requirements>
			<Text>We need an independent auditor to look into the results of the last colonial election. There was something shifty going on. No-one likes this government that much.</Text>

		<FlavorTextOption>
			<Requirements>
				<ListenerGovernment>Objectivism</ListenerGovernment>

		<FlavorTextOption>
			<Requirements>
				<ListenerGovernment>Aristocracy</ListenerGovernment>
			</Requirements>
			<Text>I haven't liked {PLANETNAME:1} since most of my family was taken to the new colony. It feels so empty here now.</Text>

		<FlavorTextOption>
			<Requirements>
				<ListenerGovernment>Singularity</ListenerGovernment>
			</Requirements>
			<Text>{LEADERNAME:1} is wrong! {LEADERNAME:1} is not flawless! Why won't anyone listen to me?</Text>
		</FlavorTextOption>

		<FlavorTextOption>
			<Requirements>
				<ListenerGovernment>Federation</ListenerGovernment>
			</Requirements>
			<Text>I think {LEADERNAME:1} has been in power for too long. Their ideas are stale. We need a change.</Text>
		</FlavorTextOption>

		<FlavorTextOption>
			<Requirements>
				<ListenerGovernment>Monarchy</ListenerGovernment>
			</Requirements>
			<Text>They say back on the old world, there used to be a government with elected leaders. Real ones, not the puppets of {LEADERNAME:1} we have now.</Text>
		</FlavorTextOption>

		<FlavorTextOption>
			<Requirements>
				<ListenerGovernment>Scientific</ListenerGovernment>
			</Requirements>
			<Text>Oh, their CV is very impressive on paper, but I'm not sure if {LEADERNAME:1} really groks what's going on in this galaxy.</Text>
		</FlavorTextOption>

		<FlavorTextOption>
			<Requirements>
				<ListenerGovernment>Theocracy</ListenerGovernment>
			</Requirements>
			<Text>{LEADERNAME:1} is weak. Chosen from above or not, it's time for a change. Another can be Chosen.</Text>
		</FlavorTextOption>

		<FlavorTextOption>
			<Requirements>
				<ListenerGovernment>Unity</ListenerGovernment>
			</Requirements>
			<Text>I... Unity sometimes misses a time before Unity. Unity has its downsides, all can see that.</Text>

		<FlavorTextOption>
			<Requirements>
				<ListenerGovernment>Utopian</ListenerGovernment>
			</Requirements>
			<Text>Everything is perfect and good, and that's good, and I approve and... I'm thinking of moving away. What is there to do if everything is perfect?</Text>
