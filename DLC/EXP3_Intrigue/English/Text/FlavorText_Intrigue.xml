			Elections require that we watch our approval rating closely. Voters will not be easily swayed by short term measures and will consider their morale over a long period. All the things that increase approval will help us win elections like lowering the tax rate and building approval improvements. Or we can consider forms of government that don't hold elections. If we lose an election we will fall to a [COLOR=UIDefaultHighlight]Coalition Government[/COLOR] which limits our power. Including blocking our ability to declare war.</Text>

        Governments are only effective at managing a certain number of worlds. After this [COLOR=UIDefaultHighlight]Colony Limit[/COLOR] is exceeded we suffer a Morale penalty for each Colony beyond this limit. Unfortunately we haven't discovered any governments that increase our Colony Limit. We should discover technologies that allow more advanced forms of government, either by research or by trading with other civilizations.
