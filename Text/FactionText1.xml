    <String>Terrans are the inventors of hyperdrive and the youngest race on the galactic stage. Although committed diplomats, Terrans have a militaristic streak that has taken many by surprise.</String>

    <Label>FACTION_TERRAN_StartupDescription</Label>
    <String>Despite being the youngest race in the galaxy, the Terrans are perhaps the most dangerous. Notably, it was their invention of the hyperdrive, and decision to spread it to their neighbors, which led to the current arms race the galaxy finds itself in. 

Although Terrans present themselves as a peaceful and diplomatic people, when they are drawn into warfare, they possess an intuitive flair for violence, and extreme willingness to exercise it. Although Terrans find nothing strange about this dichotomy, many of their galactic peers regard it as alarming, and even duplicitous.</String>
  </StringTable>
  <StringTable>
    <Label>FACTION_TERRAN_StartupTraitsDescription</Label>
    <String>Terrans are naturally adventurous, with fast, long ranging ships. Their production capacity and diplomatic abilities are well regarded. Their ability to field large fleets is regarded with a bit more wariness.</String>

    <Label>FACTION_DRENGIN_StartupDescription</Label>
    <String>The Drengin are one of the older races in the galaxy, with an internal history rich with conquest and bloodshed, dominating the lesser species of their planet. 

Cruel, but inventive, many of their victims have discovered that the Drengin are not mindlessly stupid, and can even be quite creative when it comes to the application of evil. There are few ways to devour a slaveling that the Drengin haven't thought up, though most acknowledge that simple beatings are usually the more economically prudent option.</String>
  </StringTable>
  <StringTable>
    <Label>FACTION_DRENGIN_StartupTraitsDescription</Label>
    <String>Drengin soldiers are savagely effective at ground-based combat, and their naval vessels are famously tough. Their military manufacturing ability is also impressive, but Drengin colonies do sometimes struggle with discontent. Much of their famous inventiveness is put into stopping slaveling revolts.</String>

    <String>The Altarians are a deeply religious race, and possess a unique history they claim was touched by powerful beings known as the Precursors. Kind and generous to a fault, their unique history means Altarians are prone to behaving more than a little self righteously when dealing with other, lesser races. 

For some as yet unexplained reason, Altarians appear almost identical in appearance to Terrans. Altarian prophecy has spoken of the day they would one day meet their cousins, but few know if that prophecy had anything to say about what would happen next.</String>
  </StringTable>
  <StringTable>
    <Label>FACTION_ALTARIAN_StartupTraitsDescription</Label>
    <String>Altarians are careful researchers, generally content, and influential with their neighbors. Their ships are known for being fast but fragile, though they can organize large fleets of them when called upon.</String>

Durante anos eles vagaram pela galáxia, evitando o Drengin e seus aliados até que encontraram um refúgio seguro perto da borda distante da galáxia onde puderam se reconstruir, e até mesmo começar a sonhar com um retorno à Terra. 

Os anos de peregrinação ensinaram muito à Resistência, e agora eles são especialistas em reciclagem de navios, mineração de asteróides e operação encoberta.</String>

    <String>The Iridium Corporation is the apex corporate entity of an ultra capitalistic society, the only organization capable of entering into contracts on behalf of the entire Iridium people. 

The entire Iridium culture is based on a firm, even fanatical belief in the power of free markets. Although no strangers to weaponry, all research is first considered through the lens of mutual cooperation; the destructive cost of warfare is often too great for Iridiums to seriously consider. It remains to be seen how well this philosophy will fare when introduced to more close-minded races.</String>
  </StringTable>
  <StringTable>
    <Label>FACTION_IRIDIUM_StartupTraitsDescription</Label>
    <String>Iridiums are excellent at Research and Development and quick to maximize the economic potential of any new discovery. Their ships are also far ranging, enhancing their natural inclination to trade. Growth potential is limited somewhat by their species' slower than average population growth.</String>

    <String>The Krynn are not a single race, but a coalition of sentient beings united by a shared religion. As their beliefs make clear that they will not achieve salvation until all sentient life in the galaxy follows the Way of the Krynn, the Krynn will aggressively attempt to convert their neighbors at every available opportunity.

In recent years, a secretive criminal organization has seized the reigns of power in Krynn civilization. Known as the Syndicate, they pursue the Way of the Krynn via some decidedly more sinister paths than the peaceful language of their religion might suggest.</String>
  </StringTable>
  <StringTable>
    <Label>FACTION_KRYNN_StartupTraitsDescription</Label>
    <String>The Krynn are well suited for expansion, being rapid breeders with fast, far-ranging ships. Their outspoken nature make them unpopular though, and their limited military manufacturing means they have to consider their most aggressive conversion activities very carefully.</String>

Incredibly skilled at living on and around asteroids, the Onyx are excellent miners. Additionally, most of their ship and starbase designs are influenced by or even incorporate the asteroids upon which they live.</String>

    <String>The Yor are sentient artificial beings, originally servants of a species known as the Iconians. Granted sentience by the Dread Lords, the Yor turned against their Iconian creators, apparently wiping them from the face of the galaxy. The Yor have since become viciously xenophobic, and despise all biological life forms. 

Capable of long-term planning and a surprising degree of cunning, the Yor will often speak to and negotiate with organic beings. Those beings should understand that this is but a short term ploy, and that their new friends will never rest until they, and all other organic life is destroyed.</String>
  </StringTable>
  <StringTable>
    <Label>FACTION_YOR_StartupTraitsDescription</Label>

    <String>The Iconians are the oldest of the young races, once servants to the Precursors. Creators of the Yor, they were almost wiped out when their creations were given sentience by the Dread Lords. Only a few Iconians survived, hiding in a distant colony.  

Exceedingly cautious, and not without cause, Iconians have a strong sense of fatalism. That said, they have never given up reclaiming their ancestral home, though their cautious nature has prevented them from ever pursuing this dream. Until perhaps now.</String>
  </StringTable>
  <StringTable>
    <Label>FACTION_ICONIAN_StartupTraitsDescription</Label>
    <String>Iconians are overcautious and even paranoid as a result of living in hiding for generations.

And the harsh population controls they live under have only enhanced their understanding of fertility.</String>

Reproducing by division, which effectively "kills" the original parent, only a portion of Slyne society reproduces, concentrating wisdom and political authority in a few extremely elderly members.

The Slyne possess cybernetic limbs which can be swapped out as needed to suit whatever tasks the Slyne is asked to perform, making them naturally skilled shipbuilders. Additionally, their gelatinous nature makes them very difficult to kill.</String>

Technically advanced, the Thalans are hampered by the fact that they were unable to bring much of their technology with them into the past. They now have to recreate it from scratch, with none of the tools or power sources they're accustomed to working with.</String>

The Arcean people have a long history of nobility and neutrality, but the occupation has left them much less willing to forgive offenses or tolerate threats to their freedom.</String>
