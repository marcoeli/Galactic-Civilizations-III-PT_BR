      <Text>A strange Precursor Artifact has appeared out of a tear in spacetime near the {PLAYERFACTION:3}. It has begun emitting an energy field that seems to be greatly increasing their power. This effect seems to be growing and we fear it will not stop. Others have attempted to destroy the Artifact and failed miserably. We may need to destroy the {PLAYERFACTIONLONG:3} before the Artifact turns them into a race of gods.</Text>
