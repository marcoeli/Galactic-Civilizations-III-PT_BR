      <Text>The Thalan prophecies have proven true. Left unchecked, mankind will indeed cause the destruction of the galaxy. However, the appearance of the ancient dread lord Xoran has provided us with a slim hope of stopping the Apocalypse.

We must make our way to the ancient world of Elemental (now known as Altaria) and take control of the last Shard of the Telenanth. Unfortunately, it is well behind enemy lines and heavily fortified by the Yor.</Text>

      <Text>Colonel, while securing the Sol system, I want you to investigate some disturbing information that the Thalan Ambassador has provided. 

They claim that our war with the Drengin will result in the destruction of the galaxy.</Text>

      <Text>They claim the proof can be found on the Precursor Prison planet called Yiven III.

They also claim to be from 30 years in our future. So I am skeptical, to say the least.

Regardless, I need you to investigate this Yiven III, and see if there is any truth to their story.</Text>

      <Text>Greetings. I am Xoran the last of the Dreadlords. I have been waiting in this prison for millennia to deliver one last warning to you.

Your leader has brought back a terrible tool from the pocket universe and it can only be used with terrible purpose. The Bane's power is too great, too corrupting, too evil. With it, he will destroy the galaxy, as he has done before.</Text>

      <Text>He will escape the destruction of this galaxy and flee to yet another universe, starting the cycle, once more.

You must not let this happen. You must go to the planet of Elemental and there will you find what you need to prevent this from happening again - the last Shard of the Telenanth. With it in your possession, only then can the Bane be neutralized and the cycle broken. But it will be up to D.L. Bradley to use it. 

This is his and our only hope of redemption.</Text>
