    <String>Your scientists broadcast your message, "Please give us a new world, a paradise to inhabit."

There is no immediate reply and you begin to wonder if anyone heard your message, or if there was anyone to hear it. Then your scientists notice an uninhabited planet in a solar system you control. Though all recording and measurements claim it has always been there, no one recalls having noticed it before. Apparently your message did get through.</String>

The atoms of every mountain, building and citizen of {PLANETNAME}, including those of the transmitter itself are shifted. When it is complete many of your citizens are simply missing. Oddly a few new ones have appeared.

You have your answer almost immediatly as a brief portal opens to another dimension, world or reality. Through it comes a ship unlike anything you have seen before, able to travel to the very edge of the known universe, maybe even beyond. Your citizens take to calling the ship, Messenger.

You have your answer almost immediatly as a brief portal opens to another dimension, world or reality. Through it comes a ship unlike anything you have seen before, an incredible warship able to conquer civilizations on its own. The answer seems to be clear, whatever answered you from beyond this reality has clear intentions for you: conquest.

You receive your answer almost immediately. Apparently someone is listening, and they either hate you or they have a dark sense of humor. Your response is a series of meteors that shower down on {PLANETNAME} killing millions. At least now you have your proof.

    <String>The military simulation displays clearly how military models of the last decade, and even those of the past few years are woefully out of date. Military strategy and capability is changing so quickly commanders training is nearly useless by the time they graduate. Fortunately our simulation allows us to adapt our strategy with each new development, and become more effective on the battefield.

    <String>Isolating the research computers from local time was successful and capable of performing years of research in seconds. Until the day we saw dark shapes moving within the containment field. They were shaped like Thalans. But when we opened the containment field they were gone, as well as our equipment. Though we cannot continue our experiments, at least we have the research we gained while it was running.

When the field is switched on the computers and a large part of their lab disappear entirely, lost in some other reality. Perhaps someday in the future they will reappear. Until then a large amount of their research has been lost.

In working closely with them, our ambassador works out a deal where they may remain as long as they purchase goods from nearby worlds.
