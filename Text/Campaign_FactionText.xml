    <String>Hoping to find a safe place to stage their campaign, the Terran 1st Fleet has returned to this universe near the homeworld of their former ally, the Arceans.  Upon arrival, they discover it occupied by the malevolent Drengin Empire. 

Now they must liberate Arcea and use it as a beachhead where they can stage their return to Earth.

Technically advanced, the Thalans are hampered by the fact that they were unable to bring much of their technology with them into the past. They now have to now recreate it from scratch, with none of the tools or power sources they're accustomed to working with.</String>

For some as yet unexplained reason, Altarians appear almost identical in appearance to Terrans. Altarian prophecy has spoken of the day they would one day meet their cousins, but few know if that prophecy had anything to say about what would happen next.</String>

    <String>The Iridium Corporation is the apex corporate entity of an ultra capitalistic society, the only organization capable of entering into contracts on behalf of the entire Iridium people. 

The entire Iridium culture is based on a firm, even fanatical belief in the power of free markets. Although no strangers to weaponry, all research is first considered through the lens of mutual cooperation; the destructive cost of warfare is often too great for Iridium's to seriously consider.

As their beliefs make clear that they will not achieve salvation until all sentient life in the galaxy follows the Way of the Krynn, the Krynn will aggressively attempt to convert their neighbors at every available opportunity.

In recent years, a secretive criminal organization has seized the reigns of power in Krynn civilization. Known as the Syndicate, they pursue the Way of the Krynn via some decidedly more sinister paths than the peaceful language of their religion might suggest.</String>

Granted sentience by the Dread Lords, the Yor turned against their Iconian creators, apparently wiping them from the face of the galaxy. The Yor have since become viciously xenophobic, and despise all biological lifeforms. 

Capable of long-term planning and a surprising degree of cunning, the Yor will often speak to and negotiate with organic beings.
