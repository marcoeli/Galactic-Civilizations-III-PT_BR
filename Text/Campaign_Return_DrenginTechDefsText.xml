  </StringTable>
  <StringTable>
    <Label>Return_DrenginColonizationFocus_Dec</Label>
    <String>The research slavelings have found a way to make life pleasant for those living on extreme worlds. Making things more pleasant doesn't sound like us; we're not sure how this mistake happened.</String>
  </StringTable>

    <Label>Return_DrenginIonOptimization_ShortDec</Label>
    <String>Forces our Ion Drives to be better.</String>
  </StringTable>
  <StringTable>
    <Label>Return_DrenginIonOptimization_Dec</Label>
    <String>Our Ion Drives require lots of fussy work by fussy slavelings to get the most out of. If we can make them - the engines - just a little more efficient, we'll need less of them - the slavelings.</String>
  </StringTable>
  <StringTable>

    <String>Forces our Warp Engines to be better.</String>
  </StringTable>
  <StringTable>
    <Label>Return_DrenginWarpFieldFocus_Dec</Label>
    <String>Every time we make something new, the slavelings always find new ways to improve it later. Why the slavelings can't get it right on the first try is the source of much confusion and thrashings.</String>
  </StringTable>
  <StringTable>
    <Label>Return_DrenginHyperwarpMastery_ShortDec</Label>
    <String>Forces our Hyperwarp Drives to be better.</String>
  </StringTable>
  <StringTable>
    <Label>Return_DrenginHyperwarpMastery_Dec</Label>
    <String>The research slavelings mewl that our engines are already very powerful, and asked if we're satisfied with that? So we checked. It turns out we're not.</String>
  </StringTable>
  <StringTable>
    <Label>Return_DrenginSensorOptimization_ShortDec</Label>
    <String>Forces our sensors to be better.</String>
  </StringTable>
  <StringTable>
    <Label>Return_DrenginSensorOptimization_Dec</Label>
    <String>Some of the research slavelings have taken a particular interest in studying sensors, because they figure the work is safer. To keep them motivated, we'll make sure it isn't.</String>

    <Label>Return_DrenginEnergyFieldFocus_ShortDec</Label>
    <String>Forces our sensors to be better.</String>
  </StringTable>
  <StringTable>
    <Label>Return_DrenginEnergyFieldFocus_Dec</Label>
    <String>If we throw more research slavelings at our sensor systems, we're sure to see some improvements in their efficiency. Not literally throwing, but actually... sure, let's try literally throwing.</String>
  </StringTable>

    <Label>Return_DrenginSensorMastery_ShortDec</Label>
    <String>Forces our sensors to be better.</String>
  </StringTable>
  <StringTable>
    <Label>Return_DrenginSensorMastery_Dec</Label>
    <String>The research slavelings complain that we can't see any further because of the nature of this universe. We have ordered the universe be whipped, but in the meantime, have found a few more efficiencies we could implement.</String>

  </StringTable>
  <StringTable>
    <Label>Return_DrenginPrecursorRelicFocus_Dec</Label>
    <String>These Precursor relics have a number of confusing benefits on our society. Although we don't really understand how this is occurring, we should force them to be better at it.</String>
  </StringTable>
  <StringTable>
    <Label>Return_DrenginLifeSupportOptimization_ShortDec</Label>
    <String>Forces our life support systems to be better.</String>
  </StringTable>
  <StringTable>
    <Label>Return_DrenginLifeSupportOptimization_Dec</Label>
    <String>Improving our life support systems is one of those things which sounds unnecessary, but really isn't. We need those life support systems to enable our life reduction systems to get where they need to go.</String>
  </StringTable>
  <StringTable>
    <Label>Return_DrenginSupportFieldFocus_ShortDec</Label>
    <String>Forces our life support systems to be better.</String>
  </StringTable>
  <StringTable>
    <Label>Return_DrenginSupportFieldFocus_Dec</Label>
    <String>We stationed a huge Drengin with an axe in the research labs, standing there, not saying a word. Almost immediately the researchers saw several places to improve our sensors. What a lucky coincidence.</String>
  </StringTable>
  <StringTable>
    <Label>Return_DrenginLifeSupportMastery_ShortDec</Label>
    <String>Forces our life support systems to be better.</String>
  </StringTable>
  <StringTable>
    <Label>Return_DrenginLifeSupportMastery_Dec</Label>
    <String>Making our life support systems better helps make our ships better, but more importantly, it also helps humiliate our ships' crewmembers.</String>
  </StringTable>
  <StringTable>
    <Label>Return_DrenginOrbitalSpecialization_ShortDec</Label>
    <String>Forces our slavelings to be better at doing things in orbit.</String>
  </StringTable>
  <StringTable>
    <Label>Return_DrenginOrbitalSpecialization_Dec</Label>
    <String>So it turns out that if we tie the orbital slavelings on to things, they can't float away as easy. This leash technology should open the door to a bunch of possible improvements.</String>
  </StringTable>
  <StringTable>
    <Label>Return_DrenginZeroGravityOptimization_ShortDec</Label>
    <String>Forces our ships to be better.</String>
  </StringTable>
  <StringTable>
    <Label>Return_DrenginZeroGravityOptimization_Dec</Label>
    <String>Now that we go through less slavelings when making things in space, we've discovered that some of the older and wiser ones are full of good ideas.</String>
  </StringTable>
  <StringTable>
    <Label>Return_DrenginOrbitalConstructionFocus_ShortDec</Label>
    <String>Forces our ships to be better.</String>
  </StringTable>
  <StringTable>
    <Label>Return_DrenginOrbitalConstructionFocus_Dec</Label>
    <String>Building super big ships is super fun and arousing. The more we think about it, the more clever ideas we get, which only excites us more.</String>
  </StringTable>
  <StringTable>
    <Label>Return_DrenginHullMastery_ShortDec</Label>
    <String>Forces our ships to be better.</String>
  </StringTable>
  <StringTable>
    <Label>Return_DrenginHullMastery_Dec</Label>
    <String>With our ships as big as they are, often the biggest construction challenge is making sure the slavelings don't get lost. Our new "buddy system" should lead to some more construction efficiencies.</String>
  </StringTable>
  <StringTable>
    <Label>Return_DrenginCarrierFocus_ShortDec</Label>
    <String>Forces our carriers to be better.</String>
  </StringTable>
  <StringTable>
    <Label>Return_DrenginCarrierFocus_Dec</Label>
    <String>Throwing more Drengin at a problem is a good way to solve or at least annihilate that problem. We should make our carriers better to do just that.</String>
  </StringTable>
  <StringTable>
    <Label>Return_DrenginLogisticalOptimization_ShortDec</Label>
    <String>Forces various logistical operations to be better.</String>
  </StringTable>
  <StringTable>
    <Label>Return_DrenginLogisticalOptimization_Dec</Label>
    <String>Shooting things in space is great. But to do that we have to move a lot of things around first. Like, a lot. This is boring. But if we don't get good at it, we won't get to shoot. So we're stuck.</String>
  </StringTable>
  <StringTable>

    <String>Forces our weapons to be better.</String>
  </StringTable>
  <StringTable>

    <String>Forces our beam weapons to be better.</String>
  </StringTable>
  <StringTable>
    <Label>Return_DrenginBeamWeaponOptimization_Dec</Label>
    <String>Our research slavelings seem pretty sure they can use the latest generation of materials to make our beam weapons beamier. They used more technical language though.</String>
  </StringTable>
  <StringTable>
    <Label>Return_DrenginHighEnergyFocus_ShortDec</Label>
    <String>Forces our beam weapons to be better.</String>
  </StringTable>
  <StringTable>
    <Label>Return_DrenginHighEnergyFocus_Dec</Label>
    <String>Making our beam weapons better, or at the very least brighter, is a great way to spread the good news about Drengin inventiveness to other races in the galaxy.</String>
  </StringTable>
  <StringTable>
    <Label>Return_DrenginBeamWeaponMastery_ShortDec</Label>
    <String>Forces our beam weapons to be better.</String>
  </StringTable>
  <StringTable>
    <Label>Return_DrenginBeamWeaponMastery_Dec</Label>
    <String>Our puny research slavelings claim that physics prevents our beam weapons from becoming more efficient. "So invent new physics!" we shouted. They're working on it now.</String>
  </StringTable>
  <StringTable>
    <Label>Return_DrenginMissileOptimization_ShortDec</Label>
    <String>Forces our missile systems to get better.</String>
  </StringTable>
  <StringTable>
    <Label>Return_DrenginMissileOptimization_Dec</Label>
    <String>We have annihilated thousands of asteroids, target drones, and, accidentally, target range slavelings, and have come up with a number of possible improvements for our missiles.</String>
  </StringTable>
  <StringTable>
    <Label>Return_DrenginWarheadFocus_ShortDec</Label>
    <String>Forces our missile systems to get better.</String>
  </StringTable>
  <StringTable>
    <Label>Return_DrenginWarheadFocus_Dec</Label>
    <String>The research slavelings seem to think that if we pay attention to the warheads of our missile systems we'll get better booms.</String>
  </StringTable>
  <StringTable>
    <Label>Return_DrenginPayloadMastery_ShortDec</Label>
    <String>Forces our missile systems to get better.</String>
  </StringTable>
  <StringTable>
    <Label>Return_DrenginPayloadMastery_Dec</Label>
    <String>We think we can make our missiles a bit cheaper and lighter still. The cost to our research slavelings time will be considerable, but we've ensured they don't have any hobbies, so they're ready to go.</String>
  </StringTable>
  <StringTable>

    <String>Forces our kinetic weapons to get better.</String>
  </StringTable>

  </StringTable>
  <StringTable>
    <Label>Return_DrenginKineticAccelerationFocus_Dec</Label>
    <String>The research slavelings are very excited about the latest superconductors. They are an excitable bunch. Then they said the superconductors will make our kinetic weapons better. Now everyone's excited.</String>
  </StringTable>
  <StringTable>

    <String>Forces our kinetic weapons to get better.</String>
  </StringTable>
  <StringTable>
    <Label>Return_DrenginKineticMastery_Dec</Label>
    <String>The research slavelings have been whipped to the brink of sanity, and report back that our kinetic weapons are just about as good as they can be. We'll whip them a smidge more, just to be sure.</String>
  </StringTable>
  <StringTable>

    <String>Lets us use creative invasion tactics.</String>
  </StringTable>
  <StringTable>
    <Label>Return_DrenginInvasionOptimization_Dec</Label>
    <String>When we scare the cowardly food species out of space, we'll still have to chase them down to the ground. And we should be angry at them for making us chase them.</String>

    <String>Forces our ships to die less quickly.</String>
  </StringTable>
  <StringTable>
    <Label>Return_DrenginDefensiveSpecialization_Dec</Label>
    <String>Giving a ship something that isn't a gun is a confusing idea. But if it lets them use their guns more, then that's ok we guess.</String>

    <Label>Return_DrenginBarrierSystemFocus_Dec</Label>
    <String>We brought in some new research slavelings who say they can do a better job with our shields than the old ones, and the old ones should be beaten. No love lost amongst those slavelings.</String>
  </StringTable>
  <StringTable>
    <Label>Return_DrenginShieldMastery_ShortDec</Label>
    <String>Forces our shields to be better.</String>
  </StringTable>
  <StringTable>
    <Label>Return_DrenginShieldMastery_Dec</Label>
    <String>We brought back the old research slavelings because they claimed that if we whipped their replacements enough, they could find a way to improve the shields some more.</String>
  </StringTable>
  <StringTable>
    <Label>Return_DrenginPointDefenseOptimization_ShortDec</Label>
    <String>Forces our point defenses to be better.</String>
  </StringTable>
  <StringTable>
    <Label>Return_DrenginPointDefenseOptimization_Dec</Label>

  <StringTable>
    <Label>Return_DrenginDroneSystemMastery_Dec</Label>
    <String>If we can make our drone systems even a little more efficient, we should be able to see significant cost or weight savings. Which is almost as good as researching a new gun, we suppose.</String>

    <String>Forces our armor to be better.</String>
  </StringTable>
  <StringTable>
    <Label>Return_DrenginArmorFocus_Dec</Label>

  </StringTable>
  <StringTable>
    <Label>Return_DrenginArmorMastery_Dec</Label>
    <String>Our armor is thick enough to stop all but the meanest food species from hurting us. But we can probably still make it a little lighter or cheaper.</String>

    <String>Forces our words to be better.</String>
  </StringTable>
  <StringTable>
    <Label>Return_DrenginDiplomaticSpecialization_Dec</Label>
    <String>Paying attention to the words you speak is just the most boring garbage thing to do. But if we get good at it, we might be able to convince the food species to self tenderize or something.</String>
  </StringTable>
  <StringTable>

    <String>Forces our politicians to be better.</String>
  </StringTable>
  <StringTable>

  </StringTable>
  <StringTable>
    <Label>Return_DrenginPoliticalMastery_Dec</Label>
    <String>With the right technology, we can now begin injecting our political systems directly into people's faces, making this whole politics business a lot easier, and frankly, more fun.</String>
  </StringTable>
  <StringTable>

    <String>Forces our treaties to be better.</String>
  </StringTable>
  <StringTable>
