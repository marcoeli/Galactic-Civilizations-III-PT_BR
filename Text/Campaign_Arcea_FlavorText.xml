      <Text>The Terran 1st Fleet has taken back the Arcea sector. The Terran Alliance now has a beachhead on which they can stage their return to Earth.

 The Drengin Empire has been dealt a severe blow, but not a fatal one. Their forces in the Arcea sector were but a shadow compared to the force that surrounds Earth.</Text>

    <FlavorTextOption>
      <Text>The Terran 1st Fleet's near-miraculous return to this universe has ended in tragedy. Despite the awesome power of the T.A.S. Crusader, the fleet was crushed under the heel of the ever expanding Drengin Empire.

All that remains of the Human race now is Earth, imprisoned behind its Precursor Shield, perhaps forever.</Text>
