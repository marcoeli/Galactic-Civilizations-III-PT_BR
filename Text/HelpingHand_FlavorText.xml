      <Text>Commander, an unprecedented thing has happened. We have been approached by delegation of scientists, one from each of the other races in the galaxy. They have become concerned with our rise in military power and would like to make a secret agreement with us. They are willing to give us valuable technological tools in exchange for agreeing to slow down our military build up.</Text>
