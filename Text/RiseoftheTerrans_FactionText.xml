    <String> January 2178: 10 years have passed since the Arcean Empire sent humanity the instructions to build a Stargate, inviting them to join the larger galactic community.
But humanity returned their gift in a surprising way. They reverse-engineered the Stargate technology and then took it further. Combining it with their own great breakthrough, Cascading Fusion, they were able to create a new drive system that would allow a starship to travel faster than light anywhere in the galaxy, without a Stargate.
Shortly after these well-meaning engineers shared this new "Hyperdrive" with the Arceans, all contact with them was lost.</String>

    <String>The Drengin are one of the older races in the galaxy, with an internal history rich with conquest and bloodshed, dominating the lesser species of their planet. 

Cruel, but inventive, many of their victims have discovered that the Drengin are not mindlessly stupid, and can even be quite creative when it comes to the application of evil. There are few ways to devour a slaveling that the Drengin haven't thought up, though most acknowledge that simple beatings are usually the more economically prudent option.</String>

  <StringTable>
    <Label>Haven_FACTION_DRENGIN_StartupTraitsDescription</Label>
    <String>Drengin soldiers are savagely effective at ground-based combat, and their naval vessels are famously tough. Their military manufacturing ability is also impressive, but Drengin colonies do sometimes struggle with discontent. Much of their famous inventiveness is put into stopping slaveling revolts.</String>

    <String>September 2214: Decades have passed since humanity founded its first colonies. Now these worlds have grown to be rivals of Earth itself. Together they have formed a new government, and an alliance that binds all humanity together: the Terran Alliance. 
During this time they have encountered new races, including the mysterious, and all too human Altarian Republic, and the hostile Dominion of the Korx, but Earth and its core colonies have remained unthreatened, until now.
All contact with Haven was lost. A lone scout has returned to human space, with news of the greatest loss of human life in history. Haven has been captured by an unknown race called the Xendar, and all the colonists killed.</String>
