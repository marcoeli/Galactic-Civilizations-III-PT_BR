    <String>Planetary Enhancement</String>
  </StringTable>
  <StringTable>
    <Label>IridiumPlanetaryImprovement_Dec</Label>
    <String>Identifying and realizing the potential of a raw resource is one of the most crucial skills in all of business, and colonial development is no different. But we'll require the right tools if we hope to be able to do it consistently.</String>
  </StringTable>
  <StringTable>
    <Label>IridiumPlanetarySpecialization1_Dec</Label>
    <String>Without enough food, our colonial growth rates will plateau quickly, hurting our corporation's long term potential. Increased food production should ensure that something as trivial as food doesn't become our business' limiting factor.</String>
  </StringTable>
  <StringTable>
    <Label>IridiumPlanetarySpecialization2_Dec</Label>
    <String>If we're trying to maximize the growth of our business, let's not be bashful about what the fundamental requirement for that will be. Increased population growth will mean more workers, more consumers, and more of everything else.</String>
  </StringTable>
  <StringTable>
    <Label>IridiumPlanetarySpecialization3_Dec</Label>
    <String>There's no sense having a higher workforce if they're going to work inefficiently. A program of environmental enhancements designed to encourage production will ensure workplace productivity is as high as it can be.</String>
  </StringTable>
  <StringTable>
    <Label>IridiumXenoAgriculturalAdaptation_Dec</Label>
    <String>Food is one of our most critical commodities, and an increasingly valuable one at that, considering the challenges of producing it in alien environments. Improved farms should help ensure our colonies are as well fed as possible.</String>
  </StringTable>
  <StringTable>
    <Label>IridiumAgriculturalOptimization1_Dec</Label>
    <String>Farms take up valuable space, which could be used for other, more useful structures. We should preferentially award food supply contracts to suppliers who can generate as much food per unit of area as possible.</String>
  </StringTable>
  <StringTable>
    <Label>IridiumAgriculturalOptimization2_Dec</Label>
    <String>Requiring our food suppliers to begin using standardized equipment and pre-fabricated structures should ensure new farms are built as cost effectively as possible.</String>
  </StringTable>
  <StringTable>
    <Label>IridiumAgriculturalOptimization3_Dec</Label>

  </StringTable>
  <StringTable>
    <Label>IridiumFarmingFocus1_Dec</Label>
    <String>Intelligent fertilization dispersal fields, embedded directly in the soil, are capable of monitoring the health and growth rates of crops and directing nutrients to them at the optimal rate, greatly increasing crop yield.</String>
  </StringTable>
  <StringTable>
    <Label>IridiumFarmingFocus2_Dec</Label>
    <String>Our supplier have already automated much of the work on our farms, but by switching from single-use machines to adaptable, multipurpose devices, they should be able to reduce startup costs even more.</String>
  </StringTable>
  <StringTable>
    <Label>IridiumFarmingFocus3_Dec</Label>
    <String>By limiting our selection of crops to the simplest, least labor intensive ones, our supplier have been able to reduce the operating pass-through costs for all of our farms.</String>
  </StringTable>
  <StringTable>
    <Label>IridiumLosslessFarming_Dec</Label>
    <String>Once we began treating fertilizer with the same scrutiny with which we treat our other capital, we were able to begin constructing almost perfectly efficient farms, every nutrient tracked individually on a molecular level.</String>
  </StringTable>
  <StringTable>
    <Label>IridiumAgriculturalMastery1_Dec</Label>
    <String>Our food suppliers assure us that no room for improvement remains, that we've reached the very limits of agricultural science, our crops now generating as much food as chemistry allows. Which sounds to us like it's time to find some new suppliers.</String>
  </StringTable>
  <StringTable>
    <Label>IridiumAgriculturalMastery2_Dec</Label>
    <String>By making our crops enhance fertility, our food supplier have found a way to turn our business' abundance of food into an abundance of new workers. Who said farming couldn't be sexy?</String>
  </StringTable>
  <StringTable>

  </StringTable>
  <StringTable>
    <Label>IridiumXenoIrrigation_Dec</Label>
    <String>Centralizing our irrigation efforts will help us better share and make more efficient use of the significant investment these systems represent. Food production across an entire planet should be increased as a result.</String>
  </StringTable>
  <StringTable>
    <Label>IridiumBiomassResequencing_Dec</Label>
    <String>Directly sequencing biomass into food products has long been possible, but has never resulted in a very palatable end product. But as a supplement source of fertilizer, it's well suited for increasing the efficiency of all farms on a planet.</String>
  </StringTable>
  <StringTable>
    <Label>IridiumXenoBiology_Dec</Label>
    <String>We have to ensure our workers are capable of surviving on alien worlds. For moral reasons, morale reasons, and yes, of course, for productivity reasons.</String>
  </StringTable>
  <StringTable>
    <Label>IridiumBioReplication_Dec</Label>
    <String>Reproduction is too critical to the success of our enterprise to leave in the hands of our workers, and now that we finally have the technology to do something about it, we expect our population growth curves to accelerate dramatically.</String>
  </StringTable>
  <StringTable>
    <Label>IridiumEnvironmentalEngineering_Name</Label>
    <String>Property Management</String>
  </StringTable>
  <StringTable>
    <Label>IridiumEnvironmentalEngineering_Dec</Label>

  </StringTable>
  <StringTable>
    <Label>IridiumExtremeWorldColonization_Dec</Label>
    <String>We can't ignore the opportunity that extreme worlds present us. Empty land to build upon and grow in is incredibly valuable, even if life might be tough for the workers stationed there.</String>
  </StringTable>
  <StringTable>
    <Label>IridiumColonizationFocus1_Dec</Label>
    <String>Improved floating and submersible structures should help increase the production potential of aquatic planets, making them nearly as productive as everywhere else in our business.</String>
  </StringTable>
  <StringTable>
    <Label>IridiumColonizationFocus2_Dec</Label>
    <String>It took a few iterations and a few lost fingers to finally perfect our frozen world construction practices. But now that we have, we expect production their to rise substantially.</String>
  </StringTable>
  <StringTable>
    <Label>IridiumColonizationFocus3_Dec</Label>
    <String>Thanks to some water recycling products which have recently hit the market, production capacity on barren worlds should now be greatly increased.</String>
  </StringTable>
  <StringTable>
    <Label>IridiumAtmosphericCleansing_Dec</Label>
    <String>Radioactive and toxic planets pose a challenge to our business activities, but not an insurmountable one. And they provide an avenue for growth that we can simply no longer ignore.</String>
  </StringTable>
  <StringTable>
    <Label>IridiumBiospherePerfection1_Dec</Label>
    <String>Our workers and managers on radioactive worlds will no longer have to suffer through the random mutations which plagued their careers. Aside from the obvious boost to morale, this should make everyone more productive as well.</String>
  </StringTable>
  <StringTable>
    <Label>IridiumBiospherePerfection2_Dec</Label>
    <String>All employees and subcontractors are still strongly advised against going outside, but within the confines of our colonial structures, life on toxic worlds is now much more pleasant and productive.</String>
  </StringTable>
  <StringTable>
    <Label>IridiumTerraformingTech_Dec</Label>
    <String>Making the land itself more productive is an admirable goal, and will allow us to begin making use of some of the more marginal terrain on the planets we establish our business.</String>
  </StringTable>
  <StringTable>
    <Label>IridiumHabitatImprovement_Dec</Label>
    <String>Natural ecosystems may be pretty, but they're often woefully unusable for modern business purposes. Our latest terraforming equipment should help correct that, which, in a sense, will make them even prettier.</String>
  </StringTable>
  <StringTable>
    <Label>IridiumSoilReclamation_Dec</Label>
    <String>We can now manage a planet's landmasses with far greater efficiency than nature ever could herself. Almost any terrain on a planet is now potentially usable by us.</String>
  </StringTable>
  <StringTable>
    <Label>IridiumEnvironmentalResequencing_Dec</Label>
    <String>Environmental Resequencing will increase the usable land on every planet in our corporation, dramatically increasing production potential at the cost of nothing more than a few trillion unproductive plants.</String>
  </StringTable>
  <StringTable>
    <Label>IridiumEngineeringTech_Dec</Label>
    <String>This new hyperdrive invention is the very definition of a disruptive technology. The Iridium people have never possessed something with such limitless inherent potential. Or risk. </String>
  </StringTable>
  <StringTable>
    <Label>IridiumInterstellarTravel_Dec</Label>

  </StringTable>
  <StringTable>
    <Label>IridiumIonOptimization1_Dec</Label>
    <String>An adjusted magnetic envelope should improve the ion capture technology of our Ion Drives, allowing for increased mass capture and consequently higher speeds.</String>
  </StringTable>
  <StringTable>
    <Label>IridiumIonOptimization2_Dec</Label>
    <String>Many of our engine managers, seeking ways to increase their groups' ROI, have identified multiple cost savings measures when installing new ion drives. We should implement these practices fleet wide ASAP.</String>
  </StringTable>
  <StringTable>
    <Label>IridiumIonOptimization3_Dec</Label>
    <String>Using a new type of field generation coil that's recently come on the market will help make our hyperdrives more mass efficient. A worthy pursuit, seeing as this will leave more room in our vessels for revenue generating equipment.</String>

  </StringTable>
  <StringTable>
    <Label>IridiumSensorOptimization1_Dec</Label>
    <String>Improving the processing power of our sensor systems will allow them to sift through the information returned to them more effectively, improving their overall performance.</String>
  </StringTable>
  <StringTable>
    <Label>IridiumSensorOptimization2_Dec</Label>
    <String>With our network of suppliers eagerly standing by, outsourcing the production of some of our sensor components should result in cost savings.</String>
  </StringTable>
  <StringTable>
    <Label>IridiumSensorOptimization3_Dec</Label>
    <String>Earlier generations of our sensors were needlessly crude, hardly befitting something which bears an official stamp of the Iridium people. Our latest models use the latest and lightest components, and are far more weight efficient.</String>
  </StringTable>
  <StringTable>
    <Label>IridiumEnergyFieldSensors_Dec</Label>
    <String>The fields emitted by hyperdrives are detectable at distances far outside their ship's normal light cones. And the latest generation of sensors to come on the market promise to be able to detect those fields at even greater distances than before.</String>
  </StringTable>
  <StringTable>

  </StringTable>
  <StringTable>
    <Label>IridiumSubspaceSensors_Dec</Label>
    <String>R &amp; D had recently developed a new type of sensor capable of detecting ships via a 12-dimensional region of space which marketing wants to call "Subspace." Whatever we call it, our next generation of sensors will be extremely effective.</String>
  </StringTable>
  <StringTable>
    <Label>IridiumSensorMastery1_Dec</Label>

  <StringTable>
    <Label>IridiumDefensiveSpecialization2_Dec</Label>
    <String>The supplier who constructs the feed mechanisms for our point defense systems has delivered a new version capable of higher throughputs. The increased firing rate should make our point defenses marginally more effective.</String>

  <StringTable>
    <Label>IridiumDefensiveSpecialization3_Dec</Label>
    <String>Being such a simple system, armor is a little hard to improve upon, no matter what incentives we embed in our contracts. The best our suppliers have been able to do is cut some weight out of the mounting hardware.</String>
  </StringTable>
  <StringTable>
    <Label>IridiumShieldSystems_Dec</Label>
    <String>According to the product literature, by increasing the density of our deflector arrays and rearranging their layout, we end up with a new generation of "Shield" systems, capable of providing much greater protection.</String>
  </StringTable>
  <StringTable>
    <Label>IridiumShieldOptimization1_Dec</Label>
    <String>A new version of field emitter with higher output capacity will make our shields a bit more effective at no additional cost to us.</String>
  </StringTable>
  <StringTable>
    <Label>IridiumShieldOptimization2_Dec</Label>
    <String>Shields are pretty costly, and at least a few spreadsheets have suggested we should consider accepting a higher ship-loss rate instead. Reducing shield costs should quash that argument. And keep our security departments morale up.</String>
  </StringTable>
  <StringTable>
    <Label>IridiumShieldOptimization3_Dec</Label>
    <String>Our suppliers have found a way to reduce the mass of our shield systems' field emitters. Which leaves room for more of them, or other revenue protection/generation equipment.</String>
  </StringTable>
  <StringTable>
    <Label>IridiumBarrierFieldGeneration_Dec</Label>
    <String>Barrier Fields are capable of absorbing a portion of incoming offensive energy, thus charging the very shields which will repulse it. This is an incredibly appealing prospect, if only from an energy balance sheet perspective.</String>
  </StringTable>
  <StringTable>
    <Label>IridiumBarrierSystemFocus1_Dec</Label>
    <String>Our new shield supplier has recommended we begin installing newer and more robust models of energy absorber to make our Barrier Fields a bit stronger.</String>
  </StringTable>
  <StringTable>
    <Label>IridiumBarrierSystemFocus2_Dec</Label>
    <String>Our new supplier promises the ability to deliver shield generators at lower costs than before, so long as we promise not to ask too many questions about how they're made. No problem, we said.</String>
  </StringTable>
  <StringTable>
    <Label>IridiumBarrierSystemFocus3_Dec</Label>
    <String>Apparently our shield generations were designed inefficiently by the last contractor so that they could easily trim them down later to hit their performance targets. These errors have since been corrected, reducing the mass of all our shield systems.</String>
  </StringTable>
  <StringTable>
    <Label>IridiumForceFieldTech_Dec</Label>
    <String>The latest generation of shields on the market promise to be capable of directing vast amounts of energy in the specific direction of incoming hostile energy. Our security forces should be far safer and more effective behind such technology.</String>
  </StringTable>
  <StringTable>
    <Label>IridiumShieldMastery1_Dec</Label>
    <String>A supplier can always be undercut; there's always someone willing to submit a suicidally low bid. Hopefully word doesn't get out we're doing that with our shields though. Our employees like to think we're spending a lot of money on those things.</String>
  </StringTable>
  <StringTable>
    <Label>IridiumShieldMastery2_Dec</Label>
    <String>The latest performance targets to encourage the development of lighter weight shield emitters have finally been hit, our supplier managing to shave a bit more weight off of their charging systems.</String>

    <Label>IridiumInvulnerabilityTech_Dec</Label>
    <String>Although incredibly powerful, "Invulnerable" is more of a marketing term than anything else. But it's a good one, so it's sticking.  Regardless of how actually invulnerable these shields are, it will help our security forces if everyone thinks they are.</String>
  </StringTable>
  <StringTable>
    <Label>IridiumShieldSupportSystems_Dec</Label>
    <String>A new form of shield accessory will allow ships to support the shield systems of other ships in a fleet. Along with increasing the survivability of an entire fleet, this creates a new product category for our market of suppliers to begin competing in.</String>
  </StringTable>

  <StringTable>
    <Label>IridiumPointDefenses_Dec</Label>
    <String>Point defense systems are an excellent means of defending our security forces against missile based threats. They're not so good against other threats, but we're optimistic the market will find a solution for that soon.</String>
  </StringTable>
  <StringTable>
    <Label>IridiumPointDefenseOptimization1_Dec</Label>
    <String>A recent firmware update for our point defense firing controllers has made them somewhat more accurate, leading to a stronger overall defensive capability.</String>
  </StringTable>
  <StringTable>
    <Label>IridiumPointDefenseOptimization2_Dec</Label>
    <String>Switching to a cheaper source of sub-components has allowed our point defense supplier to pass on some of the savings to us. Not all the savings of course, but that's their prerogative.</String>
  </StringTable>
  <StringTable>
    <Label>IridiumPointDefenseOptimization3_Dec</Label>
    <String>The ammunition used by our point defense systems isn't delicate, and had been over-packed in early models of those systems. Using slimmer, more compact ammunition storage modules should lead to overall weight savings for the system.</String>
  </StringTable>
  <StringTable>
    <Label>IridiumCounterMeasures_Dec</Label>
    <String>At a recent trade fair our procurement managers visited a booth featuring an electronic counter measure system which promises to confuse incoming missile attacks. As soon as we sort out the pricing, we'll have them available for our fleet.</String>
  </StringTable>
  <StringTable>
    <Label>IridiumCounterMeasureFocus1_Dec</Label>
    <String>A simple firmware patch is all that it will take to make our ECM suites more capable of confusing enemy missiles. Automatic updates should also ensure this edge never fades away as a result of improvements in the missile sector.</String>
  </StringTable>
  <StringTable>
    <Label>IridiumCounterMeasureFocus2_Dec</Label>
    <String>Now that we're the biggest, and indeed only customer of our ECM vendor, we can leverage that position to get better prices on their ECM suites. Say it quietly now, but market inefficiencies are great when they work out in our favor.</String>
  </StringTable>
  <StringTable>
    <Label>IridiumCounterMeasureFocus3_Dec</Label>
    <String>The latest update to our ECM suites consolidates some of the equipment into a single module, which causes the overall system to weigh much less.</String>
  </StringTable>
  <StringTable>
    <Label>IridiumDroneSentrySystems_Dec</Label>

  </StringTable>
  <StringTable>
    <Label>IridiumDroneSystemMastery2_Dec</Label>
    <String>The newest version of point defense drone comes in a more cube-like shape that makes them much more stackable, saving weight on various drone storage and launching systems.</String>

  <StringTable>
    <Label>IridiumPointDefenseSupportSystem_Dec</Label>
    <String>Sensor modules which improve the long range tracking ability of our point defenses will enable a single ship to boost the point defense capabilities of an entire security fleet.</String>
  </StringTable>
  <StringTable>
    <Label>IridiumPointDefenseAugmentation_Dec</Label>
    <String>The newest iteration of point defense accessory module adds improved missile disruptors which  enhance the effectiveness of an entire fleet's counter measures, giving our security forces a much needed extra layer of security.</String>
  </StringTable>
  <StringTable>
    <Label>IridiumPointDefenseManipulation_Dec</Label>
    <String>Fleet-wide drone systems expand the perimeter of our defenses even further. And the newest point defense disruptors will let our own missile attacks more easily penetrate the point defenses of high risk threats.</String>
  </StringTable>
  <StringTable>
    <Label>IridiumArmorSystems_Dec</Label>
    <String>There's something charmingly retro about armor, and the market is full of brands adorned with decorative rivets and such. Still, even in this age, armor is surprisingly effective, so let's go ahead and use it if it meets our security forces' needs.</String>
  </StringTable>
  <StringTable>
    <Label>IridiumArmorOptimization1_Dec</Label>
    <String>A supplier with a new fabrication process promises the ability to deliver denser, more resilient armor panels to us, which should make our security ships a little more capable at fending off high-risk security threats.</String>
  </StringTable>
  <StringTable>
    <Label>IridiumArmorOptimization2_Dec</Label>
    <String>A new supplier promises they'll be able to supply armor panels to us at reduced rates. Apparently the last guy was spending too much on unnecessary health &amp; safety protocols for their workers. A shame when that gets passed on to the consumer.</String>
  </StringTable>
  <StringTable>
    <Label>IridiumArmorOptimization3_Dec</Label>
    <String>So it turns out those decorative rivets and other adornments were adding unnecessary weight to our already bulky armor systems. Stripping them down to the bare essentials should result in a lighter load to carry around.</String>

  <StringTable>
    <Label>IridiumDurantiumCompositeTech_Dec</Label>
    <String>Durantium was developed by a consortium in our polymers industry. A composite of different substances, Durantium has tremendous damage absorption potential, far in excess of conventional armor plating.</String>
  </StringTable>
  <StringTable>
    <Label>IridiumArmorFocus1_Dec</Label>
    <String>Durantium composites have an unusual problem with cracking completely in half under typical end-of-life stresses. A new after-market lamination process promises to address that, making our ships just a little bit tougher.</String>
  </StringTable>
  <StringTable>
    <Label>IridiumArmorFocus2_Dec</Label>
    <String>Keeping our security ships operational is worth a lot to our business, and we armor them gladly because of it. But if it could be done for less, well, we'd probably armor them a little more gladly.</String>
  </StringTable>
  <StringTable>
    <Label>IridiumArmorFocus3_Dec</Label>
    <String>The latest version of Durantium has a slightly different configuration of layers which results in a lighter product with just the same destruction-avoidance capabilities.</String>
  </StringTable>
  <StringTable>
    <Label>IridiumKanviumLaminateTech_Dec</Label>
    <String>A new product called Kanvium claims to be a laminated armor product which partially fluidizes on impact to disperse incoming force. Whether that's marketing nonsense or not, it certainly looks more effective at stopping fast moving things.</String>
  </StringTable>
  <StringTable>
    <Label>IridiumArmorMastery1_Dec</Label>
    <String>By considering our armoring needs earlier in the ship design process, our product managers can design ships that remain just as durable while using far less armor. Tough luck for our armor suppliers, but that's the business.</String>
  </StringTable>
  <StringTable>
    <Label>IridiumArmorMastery2_Dec</Label>
    <String>If we involve our armor supplier to get involved in the design process, they might help us find ways to minimize overlap and otherwise maximize the efficiency of our armor placement, leading to reduced overall armor mass.</String>

  <StringTable>
    <Label>IridiumZeroPointArmorTech_Dec</Label>
    <String>The manufacturer of Zero Point Armor explains that it can tap into the zero-point energy of the quantum vacuum, using that energy to confront incoming energy. We have no way of determining if that's true, but it sure looks a lot tougher.</String>
  </StringTable>
  <StringTable>
    <Label>IridiumArmorSupportSystems_Dec</Label>
    <String>A new type of armor accessory has come on the market, using long range hardening fields to allow a ship to make every piece of armor in a fleet substantially more durable. Our fleet managers are reportedly ecstatic at the news.</String>
