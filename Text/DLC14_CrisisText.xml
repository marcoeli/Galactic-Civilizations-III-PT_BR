    <String>Apesar de nossos melhores esforços, nossos colonos continuam a impactar a cultura dos primatas recém-descobertos no {PLANETNAME}. Isto resultou em uma ampla gama de efeitos negativos, desde acidentes fatais até sinais de que os primatas começaram a nos adorar como deuses.</String>

    <String>Quase todos os nossos colonos votaram para evacuar {PLANETNAME}, deixando isso para os primatas gentis. Isto certamente será um sucesso para nossa economia, mas este momento será lembrado para sempre em nossa história como uma época em que fizemos algo não fácil, mas correto.

    <String>Os colonos de {PLANETNAME} rejeitaram nosso apelo para abandonar sua colônia. Em sua ira, eles invadiram o novo continente e praticamente exterminaram os primatas inteligentes de lá. Este certamente será lembrado como um dos dias mais sombrios da história de nossa civilização.

    <String>A educação dos primatas recém-descobertos provou ser mais complicada do que esperávamos inicialmente. Tivemos algum sucesso, mas agora houve múltiplos incidentes em que vidas de ambos os lados se perderam. Pior ainda, muitos dos colonos que encarregamos de educar os locais decidiram começar a viver como os próprios primatas, em uma tentativa de "voltar à natureza". Adorável para eles, mas isto dificilmente está ajudando a colônia em geral.</String>

    <String>Depois de um começo difícil, o programa de educação nativa em {PLANETNAME} começou a dar frutos. Os nativos começaram a se integrar na população maior e provaram ser muito úteis para nos ensinar sobre nossa nova colônia. Além disso, a introdução de sua cultura e arte únicas levou a um boom cultural em toda a nossa civilização.

    <String>Educar os nativos no {PLANETNAME} provou ser quase impossível. Eles se ressentem muito de nossa interferência e começaram a se rebelar contra nossa própria presença no planeta. Ironicamente, o único elemento de nossa cultura ao qual eles rapidamente se adaptaram é o uso de armas.

A cuidadosa exposição à nossa cultura e tecnologia permitiu que os nativos começassem a assumir muitas tarefas úteis como agricultura e entretenimento.

    <String>Word of a colony-wide tragedy on {PLANETNAME} has just reached us.
As it turns out the governor there had been drugging the population for some time with various experimental substances designed to boost the planet's production. Although this seemed to be working for some time, the process has since gone too far, people literally working themselves to death. The planet has since broken out in to a global riot, killing the governor and most of his officials. 
Things seem to have calmed down since then, though we expect production and morale to be low for quite some time.

The drugs he used were formulated to "energize" the people, which they apparently did, aside from the small portion of the population that simply died.
We should be able to return things to normal, but the planet's population will be going through withdrawal symptoms for some time.

With some help from our researchers, we have been able to make sure this new stimulant is safe for consumption, and will continue the experiment. The only downside appears to be that people are now too busy to reproduce.

The remaining population of the base is afraid of retaliation from these pirates, and has asked for our protection. In exchange for a new starbase, that seems reasonable.

Shortly after, the ship took off, tearing a large hole in the colony as it did so. Before we could intercept it, it vanished into some sort of controlled wormhole.
Few lives were lost in the disaster, but the resulting dust plume will be doing environmental damage for years to come.

    <String>The crew has been safely returned from the ancient ship, and indeed we have found all of them have been infected with the alien symbiotes. In worse news, any attempt to remove the creatures would be fatal. 
The upside is that the symbiotes seem to greatly boost the intelligence of their hosts, and the crew now claim to have ancient memories in their heads. Otherwise, they seem normal, as long as they are kept away from the ship.
We have transferred the infected crew to a remote research center, where they can continue to work in well-guarded safety.

Our researchers claim that they are still themselves, just now with the memories of ancient beings inside them.
The local government has agreed to let them continue to study and repair the ancient ship, as long as they continue to share with us what they learn.

    <String>While sealing off the site of the ancient ship, the compromised crew activated some sort of energy barrier, cutting off all communications to the ship.
Shortly after losing contact with our team, the entire ship came to life and took off, tearing a large hole in the colony. Before we could intercept it vanished into some sort of controlled wormhole. 
The ship and all its knowledge have been lost, and the resulting dust plume will be doing environmental damage for years to come.

Fortunately, many of our forces had already entered the ship when the field went up, and were able to eliminate the infected scientists and lower the field.
Fearing contamination, the military has since burned all the remaining symbiotes on the ship, leaving just the hardware behind for us to study and adapt as our own.

    <String>Upon its arrival near {PLANETNAME} our researchers activated the Precursor power plant and watched as the artifact instantly created a powerful force field that surrounded the planet. 
The good news is the field generates huge amounts of power we should be able to tap for just about any use.
The bad news is the field is impenetrable and {PLANETNAME}'s population is trapped inside. Currently, they seem to be unharmed and functioning normally, but they will never leave the planet as long as the artifact is active.
Unfortunately, the bond with the planet seems to be unbreakable by anything short of destroying the power planet itself.</String>

When we opened fire on the device it seems to have gone into some sort of lockdown mode, and shut down the shield.

After some hasty construction, they built a ship capable of reaching the artifact on the inside of the shield, and attempted to blow it up with nuclear charges. Immediately the artifact went into some sort of protective mode, and shut down the field before moving out of the system at hyper-warp speeds, taking a large portion of the planet's atmosphere with it.

    <String>Our researchers have managed to destroy the prototype terraforming device on {PLANETNAME}.
We were fortunate that a member of our team had worked with the missing scientist in the past, and knew how to do this safely. If done wrong, the experimental power core inside might have ruptured, causing a shockwave that would have "reprogrammed" every living thing on the planet's surface.

    <String>Our researchers have made several breakthroughs while studying the prototype terraforming device.
While they have not been able to reproduce the planet-wide effect, they have been able to produce a more localized wave that could terraform a small continent almost instantly.

    <String>When attempting to disassemble the prototype terraforming device on {PLANETNAME}, our researchers have apparently caused a horrible accident.
The device triggered accidentally, sending out a shockwave that reprogrammed all the biological matter on the planet, killing everyone instantly.
If there is a silver lining to this horrible tragedy, the planet itself has been left mostly intact and now contains far more livable land.

    <String>We were able to find a dead planet in the Goldilocks zone of a nearby solar system, perfect for testing the prototype device on. As advertised, the device worked almost instantly and transformed the planet into a livable world in less then a week.
Unfortunately, by using the device we no longer have it to study, and our best scientists still don't have any idea how it worked.

    <String>Our investigators have reached {PLANETNAME}, and have found the ship she left the shipyard on. 
The ship in question belongs to a known arms dealer with connections to several foreign powers,
 and is currently orbiting a dead world. We have no idea if she is on the ship as a passenger or a prisoner.
At the same time, the local authorities have informed us that before the scientist vanished she was receiving death threats from a radical group claiming she was playing god.</String>

    <String>Our forces attempted to disable the ship carrying the missing scientist, but something they were working on must have been activated when we opened fire. The ship exploded in an immense shockwave, destroying both the ship and our own forces instantly. 
When we sent another vessel to the system to check for survivors, they found a brand new habitable planet near where the ship had been.
