      <Text>To trade with other races, request items from their list on the right of the screen and offer your own items from your inventory on the left.
 [ICON=Bullet] The more you request, the less likely a race will be to accept.
 [ICON=Bullet] Each race values their assets differently, so you can often buy from one race and sell to another.
 [ICON=Bullet] Some trades, such as treaties, have a duration. Make sure you are willing to make a commitment before taking them.</Text>
