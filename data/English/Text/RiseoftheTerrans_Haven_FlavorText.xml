      <Text>Humanity has taken its place among the stars. Having overcome its own worst nature, Earth and its colonies have come together to begin a new era.
Forming a new government that binds them together, the new Terran Alliance is ready to face whatever the galaxy has in store.</Text>

      <Text>The United Earth government's first steps into the stars have ended in tragedy, giving birth to its own destruction in the form of the Stellar Guild. 
But at least humanity remains, in the form of the Stellar Guild. The question is, will they grow to become a great galaxy-spanning civilization, or will they turn on each other and become nothing more than the galaxy's first pirates?</Text>
