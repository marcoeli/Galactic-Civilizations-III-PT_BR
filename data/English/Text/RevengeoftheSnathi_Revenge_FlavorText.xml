      <Text>Lord Snarky.
The shipyard we have hidden in the asteroid belt has finally been able to patch together a space-worthy vessel that we think is fast enough to avoid the Wardens. Unfortunately its range is dismal, but it should be able to survey the immediate area, and find out what is left of our foes.</Text>

We have been looking through the ruins of the Terran improvements and found a communication message from a nearby planet. It appears that their headquarters is in this sector.</Text>

      <Text>My Lord.

We have the Terrans on the run! Their sector headquarters has fallen and we have been able to salvage most of their improvements. These systems should be capable of building new Snathi fleets very quickly.</Text>

      <Text>Lord Snarky, you have proven to be harder to step on than we thought. You can have this pathetic corner of space.
