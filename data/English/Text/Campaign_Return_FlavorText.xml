      <Text>The Terran 1st Fleet has returned home. D.L. Bradley has used the powerful Precursor artifact that powered the T.A.S. Crusader to bring down the imprisoning Precursor Shield that had encapsulated Earth. 

Earth has not been idle during its long imprisonment.

The Crusade has begun.</Text>

      <Text>The Terran 1st Fleet's near-miraculous return to this universe has ended in tragedy. Despite the awesome power of the T.A.S. Crusader, the fleet was crushed under the heel of the ever expanding Drengin Empire.

All that remains of the Human race now is Earth, imprisoned behind its Precursor Shield, perhaps forever.</Text>

      <Text>The time has come to make our push for Earth. 

Your orders are simple: Destroy the Drengin forces near Earth. Once you have secured the area, get the T.A.S. Crusader to Earth so I can bring down the shield.</Text>

      <Text>Ok, Commander, this is it, there are a series of Drengin colonies directly in our path to Earth. I recommend you secure them as we move forward.

They will be perfect stepping stones, and if we secure them all it will cut the Drengin forces in this sector in half.</Text>

      <Text>Well done, Commander. Unfortunately Crey's Folly, was the weakest Drengin colony in the area. They have been entrenched for nearly 10 years. Each world we face will be more heavily defended than the other. 

I suggest you get our new colonies producing reinforcements as quickly as possible.</Text>

      <Text>Welcome cousins, we had given up hope of your return. Our war with the Drengin does not go well.

      <Text>Commander, we have found the system the Drengin have been using as a base of operations near Earth. They have taken Proxima Andromedae, and are using it as a rallying point for their forces.
