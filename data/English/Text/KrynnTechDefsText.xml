  <StringTable>
    <Label>KrynnTechTree_Dec</Label>
    <String>Tech tree focused on Influence and Approval.</String>
  </StringTable>
  <StringTable>
    <Label>KrynnColonizationTech_Dec</Label>
    <String>We cannot remain on Krynn indefinitely if we hope to spread the Way to every sentient being in the galaxy. We must expand.</String>
  </StringTable>
  <StringTable>
    <Label>KrynnXenoIndustrializationTech_Dec</Label>
    <String>Adapting even our most basic technology to work on alien worlds is a serious challenge. But no challenge is too great for a people infused with our inner strength.</String>
  </StringTable>
  <StringTable>
    <Label>KrynnIndustrialSpecialization1_Dec</Label>
    <String>Manufacturing capacity will prove critical to enriching ourselves as we expand throughout space. And it will of course be useful when and if we need to spread the Path via forceful means. </String>
  </StringTable>
  <StringTable>
    <Label>KrynnIndustrialSpecialization2_Dec</Label>
    <String>New technology always offers the opportunity for profit, whether via artificial scarcity, or even simple counterfeiting. In the long term, our mastery of the physical world will help us spread the Path further and faster.</String>
  </StringTable>
  <StringTable>
    <Label>KrynnIndustrialSpecialization3_Dec</Label>
    <String>Blasphemers within our civilization, who reject both the Path and the Path of Shadows, have long sapped our construction sector. If we can finally crush their influence, that will leave more funds in the treasury for our other needs.</String>
  </StringTable>
  <StringTable>
    <Label>KrynnAdvancedConstruction_Dec</Label>
    <String>Advanced factories will help increase our manufacturing capacity, ensuring our people have the tools they need to continue their journeys along the Path.</String>
  </StringTable>
  <StringTable>
    <Label>KrynnConstructionOptimization1_Dec</Label>
    <String>With the right motivation techniques we can ensure our workers are as committed to the Path as possible, and understand the important of production in spreading it. This should boost production.</String>
  </StringTable>
  <StringTable>
    <Label>KrynnConstructionOptimization2_Dec</Label>
    <String>Using our peers within the Secret Order to identify and purge the blasphemers, we can ensure managers within our manufacturing sector are loyally committed to the Path, and willing to make all necessary sacrifices to reduce our manufacturing costs.</String>
  </StringTable>
  <StringTable>
    <Label>KrynnConstructionOptimization3_Dec</Label>
    <String>An increased security presence should limit the protection rackets which have long inflicted our manufacturing sector. All manufacturing maintenance costs should now be reduced.</String>
  </StringTable>
  <StringTable>
    <Label>KrynnXenoManufacturingMethods_Dec</Label>
    <String>Thanks to the enlightened work of our researchers, we're now able to build a new generation of exotic manufacturing centers. </String>
  </StringTable>
  <StringTable>
    <Label>KrynnManufacturingFocus1_Dec</Label>
    <String>The need for a military is not always clear to Krynn who have yet to see the Way. But when we make them understand that ascension will not be possible until all sentient life has begun along the Path, even by force, the need becomes clearer.</String>
  </StringTable>
  <StringTable>
    <Label>KrynnManufacturingFocus2_Dec</Label>
    <String>Civilian manufacturing allows us to build the cultural structures and Krynniac facilities we need to show people the Path. All Krynn, regardless of species, caste, or clan, can surely see that.</String>
  </StringTable>
  <StringTable>
    <Label>KrynnManufacturingFocus3_Dec</Label>
    <String>Internal audits, inquisitions, and random locker inspections should help catch any remaining heretics within our manufacturing sector, and reduce our manufacturing costs a bit more.</String>
  </StringTable>
  <StringTable>
    <Label>KrynnIndustrialExpertise_Dec</Label>
    <String>Our researchers have found a way to manipulate matter on the level of individual atoms. Crude to someone who understands the majesty of the Way, but this mastery of physical matter will allow us to increase our manufacturing capacity even more.</String>
  </StringTable>
  <StringTable>
    <Label>KrynnIndustrialMastery1_Dec</Label>
    <String>Our military manufacturing is now as efficient as it can be. We shall soon force the Path into the minds of all who have resisted its brilliance.</String>
  </StringTable>
  <StringTable>
    <Label>KrynnIndustrialMastery2_Dec</Label>
    <String>The structures which assure our people's quality of life and assist with the spread of the Path can now be made for far fewer resources.</String>
  </StringTable>
  <StringTable>
    <Label>KrynnPracticalFusion_Dec</Label>
    <String>Cascading fusion reactors will allow our manufacturing plants to be more effective. Although these represent an enormous security risk, even the most vicious heretics wouldn't be foolish enough to tamper with them.</String>
  </StringTable>
  <StringTable>
    <Label>KrynnQuantumPower_Dec</Label>
    <String>The energy stored in the quantum zero point state will grant our manufacturing plants an almost limitless source of power. This is a gift from the creator, and we must use it wisely.</String>
  </StringTable>
  <StringTable>
    <Label>KrynnInstitutionalResearch_Dec</Label>
    <String>Researching the physical world may seem trivial to those of us who fully understand the Way. Yet we must remain in this physical world until the Way has been spread to all sentient life. This will take awhile, so we'd better get good at it.</String>
  </StringTable>
  <StringTable>
    <Label>KrynnResearchOptimization1_Dec</Label>
    <String>The Path is more flexible than most people know, and with the right adjustments, we can grant our faithful researchers the time they need to conduct research, while still keeping up the spiritual duties the Path requires.</String>
  </StringTable>
  <StringTable>
    <Label>KrynnResearchOptimization2_Dec</Label>
    <String>Our researchers are blinded by both their work and their commitment to the Path. Certainly too blind to pay attention to trivial secular things like money. With the right managers, we should be able to cut down on our research costs quite a bit.</String>
  </StringTable>
  <StringTable>
    <Label>KrynnResearchOptimization3_Dec</Label>
    <String>However important research is, the Secret Order will not tolerate our government spending resources wastefully. We should ensure our research facilities consume as few of our resources as possible.</String>
  </StringTable>
  <StringTable>
    <Label>KrynnResearchCenters_Dec</Label>
    <String>Advanced research facilities will give our researchers the tools they need to push back the veil of darkness of the physical world, making it a little bit more like the world of unencumbered light that is the Way.</String>
  </StringTable>
  <StringTable>
    <Label>KrynnIntegratedResearch_Dec</Label>
    <String>Advanced academies can accommodate teams of researchers working on larger, more complicated projects, and provide the spiritual support those researchers need to maintain their own individual progress along the Path.</String>
  </StringTable>
  <StringTable>
    <Label>KrynnResearchMatrixTech_Dec</Label>
    <String>A massive city-sized research facility will allow our researchers the time they need to make the biggest breakthroughs. And isolating them from the general population will make it easier to protect them from the distressing cries of blasphemers.</String>
  </StringTable>
  <StringTable>
    <Label>KrynnDeeperKnowledge_Dec</Label>
    <String>There are curious parallels between the physical world and the Way. Research teams dedicated to studying these congruencies may be able to make incredible breakthroughs.</String>
  </StringTable>
  <StringTable>
    <Label>KrynnQuantumUnderstanding_Dec</Label>
    <String>It should come as no surprise, but our grasp over the Way has led us to startling truths about the quantum world. Both this plane and the next are falling open before us.</String>
  </StringTable>
  <StringTable>
    <Label>KrynnBeyondMortality_Dec</Label>
    <String>Ascension will make us immortal, allowing us to bring the Way to the plane beyond this one. The Secret Order is both pleased and terrified, trembling about what this change implies for their control. But there is no stopping the process now.</String>
  </StringTable>
  <StringTable>
    <Label>KrynnResearchCoordination_Dec</Label>
    <String>As devout as they are, our researchers are by their nature, a bit absentminded. We'll be able to get the most out of them by constructing coordination centers to organize their work and keep them focused on the task at hand.</String>
  </StringTable>
  <StringTable>
    <Label>KrynnNeroLinking_Dec</Label>
    <String>Direct brain-to-brain communication will greatly increase the effectiveness of our researchers, and make it far easier for us to monitor them for blasphemous thoughts or the presence of outside influences.</String>
  </StringTable>
  <StringTable>
    <Label>KrynnCoordinationTempleTech_Name</Label>
    <String>Coordination Temple</String>
  </StringTable>
  <StringTable>
    <Label>KrynnCoordinationTempleTech_ShortDec</Label>
    <String>Allows construction of the Coordination Temple.</String>
  </StringTable>
  <StringTable>
    <Label>KrynnCoordinationTempleTech_Dec</Label>
    <String>The coordination of labor and spiritual health of our devoted workers can be tended to by specially trained curates who already have mastered critical aspects of the Path.</String>
  </StringTable>
  <StringTable>
    <Label>KrynnLaborMissionTech_Name</Label>
    <String>Labor Mission</String>
  </StringTable>
  <StringTable>
    <Label>KrynnLaborMissionTech_ShortDec</Label>
    <String>Allows construction of the Labor Mission.</String>
  </StringTable>
  <StringTable>
    <Label>KrynnLaborMissionTech_Dec</Label>
    <String>The purpose of  the Path is to ensure that every person has the rules and structure needed to find their own personal happiness, and eventually the Way. Facilities to assist workers with this journey will help them contribute better to our civilization.</String>
  </StringTable>
  <StringTable>
    <Label>KrynnLaborOracleTech_Name</Label>
    <String>Labor Oracle</String>
  </StringTable>
  <StringTable>
    <Label>KrynnLaborOracleTech_ShortDec</Label>
    <String>Allows construction of the Labor Oracle.</String>
  </StringTable>
  <StringTable>
    <Label>KrynnLaborOracleTech_Dec</Label>
    <String>On rare nights, Krynn are born that possess the ability to see into another's eyes and take the true measure of their potential. By placing these gifted individuals in the right places, we can ensure all our workers are walking the proper Path for them.</String>
  </StringTable>
  <StringTable>
    <Label>KrynnPlanetaryImprovement_Dec</Label>
    <String>The planets we settle on will require a variety of structures, for food production, places of worship, and internal monitoring.</String>
  </StringTable>
  <StringTable>
    <Label>KrynnPlanetarySpecialization1_Dec</Label>
    <String>Our researchers have found a forgotten species of crop from our own world which adapts well to alien environments. Food production should go up as a result.</String>
  </StringTable>
  <StringTable>
    <Label>KrynnPlanetarySpecialization2_Dec</Label>
    <String>With a few simple changes to the appropriate elements of the Path, we can tie some of our rituals surrounding food to the importance of fertility. With the right touch, and some gentle winking, our population growth rates should increase as a result.</String>
  </StringTable>
  <StringTable>
    <Label>KrynnPlanetarySpecialization3_Dec</Label>
    <String>Adapting some of our crops to include mild stimulants will ensure our workers can work longer and harder, improving the production capacity without impacting the time they need to pursue the Path.</String>
  </StringTable>
  <StringTable>
    <Label>KrynnXenoAgriculturalAdaptation_Dec</Label>
    <String>The blasphemers within our civilization have far less influence over our colonies than they do on our home world. If we increase our farming potential to expand our colonies faster, we can ensure more Krynn stay on the right and true Path.</String>
  </StringTable>
  <StringTable>
    <Label>KrynnAgriculturalOptimization1_Dec</Label>
    <String>Placing a loyal curate in charge of each farm, to "bless" the food as it is produced will ensure that less of it goes "missing" in production, indirectly boosting our farm production.</String>
  </StringTable>
  <StringTable>
    <Label>KrynnAgriculturalOptimization2_Dec</Label>
    <String>If we directly procure startup equipment for our farmers, instead of forcing them to take the unfairly inflated prices our black market offers, we can reduce the startup costs of our farms somewhat.</String>
  </StringTable>
  <StringTable>
    <Label>KrynnAgriculturalOptimization3_Dec</Label>
    <String>A sad thing, placing members of the Shadow Path around our farms, but if it cuts down on the vandalism and extortion threats, it should be cheaper to run our farms.</String>
  </StringTable>
  <StringTable>
    <Label>KrynnIntensiveFarming_Dec</Label>
    <String>Our multi-racial nature means that we're already used to growing wide varieties of crops to suit various diets. The variety of crops needed, and the space that requires has made our farmers experts at growing in even the most marginal conditions. </String>
  </StringTable>
  <StringTable>
    <Label>KrynnFarmingFocus1_Dec</Label>
    <String>Our researchers have discovered that if we force our farmers to implement a different code of fertilization techniques, we should see greater food production. A change to the Farmers' Path is in order.</String>
  </StringTable>
  <StringTable>
    <Label>KrynnFarmingFocus2_Dec</Label>
    <String>The Secret Order has quietly suggested we reduce the costs of starting a farm by simply giving our farmers less money. The farmers don't seem happy about it, but they do the work anyways, because they have to. The Secret Order is wise.</String>
  </StringTable>
  <StringTable>
    <Label>KrynnFarmingFocus3_Dec</Label>
    <String>The creator saw fit to bless worlds across the galaxy with plants edible by us, and by taking the strains and species which adapt to the widest range of environments, we can ensure our farms operate much more cost-efficiently.</String>
  </StringTable>
  <StringTable>
    <Label>KrynnLosslessFarming_Dec</Label>
    <String>Our researchers have developed a way to insert inventory tracking devices into food as soon as it's produced, which should dramatically cut down on the mysterious losses we attribute to theft by heretics.</String>
  </StringTable>
  <StringTable>
    <Label>KrynnAgriculturalMastery1_Dec</Label>
    <String>By replacing our monitoring curates with automated food blessing systems, we can remove a bottleneck that had been holding back our food production capacity.</String>
  </StringTable>
  <StringTable>
    <Label>KrynnAgriculturalMastery2_Dec</Label>
    <String>The example set by our farmers now serves as a symbol of Krynn fertility, and with the right change to the Path, we can make that symbol a legally meaningful one. Mere proximity to farms will now require our people to reproduce more.</String>
  </StringTable>
  <StringTable>
    <Label>KrynnFoodDistributionTech_Dec</Label>
    <String>Distributing different types of food to the many races of the Krynn is something we mastered millennia ago. Adapting these tools and techniques to new worlds will be a small challenge for a people so enlightened.</String>
  </StringTable>
  <StringTable>
    <Label>KrynnXenoIrrigation_Dec</Label>
    <String>A member of the Secret Order has approached us with a request to permit his organization to begin constructing large scale irrigation systems for our colonies. A large contract to just give away, but the benefit to our food production is undeniable.</String>
  </StringTable>
  <StringTable>
    <Label>KrynnBiomassResequencing_Dec</Label>
    <String>Biomass resequencers will allow us to turn compost into food. This will boost the production of neighboring farms, but also create a black market for compost. Let's make sure the Secret Order get their foot into that business before we begin. </String>
  </StringTable>
  <StringTable>
    <Label>KrynnXenoBiology_Dec</Label>
    <String>Due to our unique heritage, the Krynn are already familiar with multi-species medical issues.  Adapting this philosophy to the challenges posed by alien biospheres is a small step, but one that must still be taken. Our people deserve proper medical care.</String>
  </StringTable>
  <StringTable>
    <Label>KrynnPopulationEnhancement_Dec</Label>
    <String>The Path governs the way our people must live their lives as they slowly come closer to the Way. It is not a static thing, and by adjusting it wisely, we can require our people to attend the fertility clinics necessary for building a strong population.</String>
  </StringTable>
  <StringTable>
    <Label>KrynnBioReplication_Dec</Label>
    <String>Bio-replication has profound ethical considerations, even if the boost to our population growth rate is too significant to ignore. The potential for criminal mischief is very real. Some of the proposals the Secret Order are suggesting  are terrifying.</String>
  </StringTable>
  <StringTable>
    <Label>KrynnEnvironmentalEngineering_Dec</Label>
    <String>Thanks to our researchers' efforts, we can now manipulate the terrain of a planet with the same ease with which we shape the hearts and minds of our people.</String>
  </StringTable>
  <StringTable>
    <Label>KrynnExtremeWorldColonization_Dec</Label>
    <String>Composed of a wide variety of races, capable of surviving in a variety of environmental envelopes, gives the Krynn a unique ability to colonize worlds too difficult for single-species civilizations.</String>
  </StringTable>
  <StringTable>
    <Label>KrynnColonizationFocus1_Dec</Label>
    <String>Thanks to many simultaneous advances in environmental and engineering research, aquatic worlds will no longer have reduced production, and can now be settled by the full spectrum of Krynn species.</String>
  </StringTable>
  <StringTable>
    <Label>KrynnColonizationFocus2_Dec</Label>
    <String>Frozen worlds will kill less of our people now. Except when inquisitors from the Shadow Path deem it necessary, of course.</String>
  </StringTable>
  <StringTable>
    <Label>KrynnColonizationFocus3_Dec</Label>
    <String>Life on barren worlds is now far more tolerable, thanks to our dedicated researchers. A special requirement of the Path for those who dwell on such planets now requires them to thank those researchers via prayer.</String>
  </StringTable>
  <StringTable>
    <Label>KrynnAtmosphericCleansing_Dec</Label>
    <String>Thanks to our control over the texts that make up and interpret the Path, we can make Krynn live on even the foulest and most toxic planetary environments. Enemies of the Secret Order make ideal candidates.</String>
  </StringTable>
  <StringTable>
    <Label>KrynnBiospherePerfection1_Dec</Label>
    <String>Even mutants can follow the Path, and they find more acceptance in Krynn society than they would elsewhere. But that's no reason to make mutants unnecessarily. Our technology has now made radioactive worlds perfectly safe.</String>
  </StringTable>
  <StringTable>
    <Label>KrynnBiospherePerfection2_Dec</Label>
    <String>With our latest technology, we shall lose no more Krynn to hellacious toxic environments. We pray for those so lost, and promise to them that we shall not rest until the Way has reached everyone, so that we might rejoin them in the afterlife.</String>
  </StringTable>
  <StringTable>
    <Label>KrynnTerraformingTech_Dec</Label>
    <String>A people made up of a number of different races is capable of making use of a far greater variety of biomes than a civilization with a less diverse make-up.</String>
  </StringTable>
  <StringTable>
    <Label>KrynnHabitatImprovement_Dec</Label>
    <String>We must be sure to protect out most advanced terraforming processes, lest they fall into the hands of blasphemers. The Secret Order insist that this technology must serve their purposes above all others.</String>
  </StringTable>
  <StringTable>
    <Label>KrynnSoilReclamation_Dec</Label>
    <String>We now have the capability of fabricating land from almost nothing, allowing Krynn to pursue their Paths on formerly unusable terrain.</String>
  </StringTable>
  <StringTable>
    <Label>KrynnEnvironmentalResequencing_Dec</Label>
    <String>Environmental resequencing adds usable land to all planets in our power. This is a monumental technology, that shouldn't belong in the hands of a mortal. We're lucky the Secret Order wields power so wisely.</String>
  </StringTable>
  <StringTable>
    <Label>KrynnEngineeringTech_Dec</Label>
    <String>This hyperdrive invention of the humans will dramatically speed up our efforts to convert the rest of the galaxy to the Way.</String>
  </StringTable>
  <StringTable>
    <Label>KrynnInterstellarTravel_Dec</Label>
    <String>If we can make better ships, faster, far-seeing, or longer lasting, we'll be able to spread the Way faster. And more comfortable ships could be an important favor to offer Krynn we want to reward.</String>
  </StringTable>
  <StringTable>
    <Label>KrynnInterstellarSpecialization1_Dec</Label>
    <String>These hyperdrives of the humans have a number of inefficiencies. "Clever, but not wise," would be an excellent way to describe them. We'll improve the drives now, and the humans later.</String>
  </StringTable>
  <StringTable>
    <Label>KrynnInterstellarSpecialization3_Dec</Label>
    <String>Improved life support recirculation systems will not only increase our ships' effective ranges, they'll make our crews more comfortable, and better able to remain on the Path.</String>
  </StringTable>
  <StringTable>
    <Label>KrynnIonDriveTech_Dec</Label>
    <String>Our researchers have found that by capturing ions during hyperdrive flight and adding them to the exhaust of our conventional engines we can travel faster. The Secret Order insists we reward these researchers for their genius.</String>
  </StringTable>
  <StringTable>
    <Label>KrynnIonOptimization1_Dec</Label>
    <String>A modification to the magnetic field capture device should lead to higher ion capture rates and higher speeds for our vessels.</String>
  </StringTable>
  <StringTable>
    <Label>KrynnIonOptimization2_Dec</Label>
    <String>The field coils of our Ion Drives were over-specced, possibly to give a supplier tied to the Secret Order a cushy deal. We've fixed that, which should lower our drive costs, and are considering how to delicately raise this issue with our shadowy masters.</String>
  </StringTable>
  <StringTable>
    <Label>KrynnIonOptimization3_Dec</Label>
    <String>Our early hyperdrives were very heavy, made by an associate of the Secret Order who was perhaps less than capable. After much internal struggle, we've stripped them of their contract and found another "friend"  who can deliver lighter drives to us.</String>
  </StringTable>
  <StringTable>
    <Label>KrynnWarpFieldTheory_Dec</Label>
    <String>"Stacked" hyperfields will magnify the acceleration effect they offer. These Warp fields will allow us to spread the Way to the distant corners of the galaxy much more rapidly.</String>
  </StringTable>
  <StringTable>
    <Label>KrynnWarpFieldFocus1_Dec</Label>
    <String>Our ever pious researchers have found new ways to arrange the stacked hyperfields, leading to improved speed for all of our Warp Drives.</String>
  </StringTable>
  <StringTable>
    <Label>KrynnWarpFieldFocus2_Dec</Label>
    <String>A critical part of our hyperfield generators was being manufactured by a supplier who was willing to lower his prices after a few late night visits by our friends in the Secret Order. Bless his generosity.</String>
  </StringTable>
  <StringTable>
    <Label>KrynnWarpFieldFocus3_Dec</Label>
    <String>A redesign of our hyperfield generators to accommodate the fact that we're now equipping them in parallel should lead to lower overall mass for these systems.</String>
  </StringTable>
  <StringTable>
    <Label>KrynnHyperwarpWaves_Dec</Label>
    <String>Hyperwarp uses cascading warp fields to allow out drives to compress already compressed space. The light that shines on our researchers' minds is sometimes a wondrous thing.</String>
  </StringTable>
  <StringTable>
    <Label>KrynnHyperwarpMastery1_Dec</Label>
    <String>It's not that we've gotten rid of all the waste in our hyperdrive construction, although we have gotten rid of most of it. It's just that all that waste that remains is going to the right parties. </String>
  </StringTable>
  <StringTable>
    <Label>KrynnHyperwarpMastery2_Dec</Label>
    <String>The Secret Order has found a supplier willing to deliver new, low-mass plasma conduits to us at the same cost as previous models. How fortunate we are that so many Krynn are willing to makes sacrifices of their own to help spread the Way.</String>
  </StringTable>
  <StringTable>
    <Label>KrynnStellarFoldingTech_Dec</Label>
    <String>Stellar folding drives will warp space around our ships as never before. The glory of the Way will arrive where we choose faster than ever.</String>
  </StringTable>
  <StringTable>
    <Label>KrynnHyperfieldProjection_Dec</Label>
    <String>Our researchers have found ways to generate hyperfields that can affect the speed of an entire fleet. The ships chosen to hold such technology will be enormously influential, and must be staffed by our most faithful crews.</String>
  </StringTable>
  <StringTable>
    <Label>KrynnGravityFieldManipulation_Dec</Label>
    <String>Gravity Field manipulators will grant our vessels increased maneuverability and tactical options in those unfortunate situations when the Way is aggressively resisted by primitive minds.</String>
  </StringTable>
  <StringTable>
    <Label>KrynnHyperfieldDisruption_Dec</Label>
    <String>A variant of the speed boosting technology can now be used to restrict the speed of any ships we so choose. The potential for criminal mischief with such a technology is high; The Secret Order insist we keep it under close watch.</String>
  </StringTable>
  <StringTable>
    <Label>KrynnStellarFieldProjection_Dec</Label>
    <String>Our speed boosting modules can now effectively "tow" ships with less capable drives. This will allow us to equip our less faithful crews with less capable ships, without compromising fleet effectiveness.</String>
  </StringTable>
  <StringTable>
    <Label>KrynnInterstellarSurvey_Dec</Label>
    <String>Throughout the history of our various peoples, success has always hinged on knowing more than your adversary. Sensors and survey equipment will illuminate the galaxy to us, showing us the path forward.</String>
  </StringTable>
  <StringTable>
    <Label>KrynnSensorOptimization1_Dec</Label>
    <String>Our researchers have developed new algorithms for processing the information our sensors return, turning data from greater distances into usable intelligence.</String>
  </StringTable>
  <StringTable>
    <Label>KrynnSensorOptimization2_Dec</Label>
    <String>Our sensors detect the perturbations emitted by hyperfields to detect ships moving faster than the speed of light. The equipment used to do this was initially quite costly, but our researchers have found ways to bring the prices down a little.</String>
  </StringTable>
  <StringTable>
    <Label>KrynnSensorOptimization3_Dec</Label>
    <String>The more sensor equipment we can squeeze in our vessels the better, making this new lighter-weight sensor equipment our researchers have developed very valuable indeed.</String>
  </StringTable>
  <StringTable>
    <Label>KrynnEnergyFieldSensors_Dec</Label>
    <String>The space folding perturbations emitted by ships traveling via hyperdrive are detectable at much greater distances than we'd previously thought. Our researchers have developed new sensors capable of using this new technique.</String>
  </StringTable>
  <StringTable>
    <Label>KrynnEnergyFieldFocus1_Dec</Label>
    <String>Additional shielding to isolate our sensors from the energy emitted by the ships carrying them seems to improve their ability.</String>
  </StringTable>
  <StringTable>
    <Label>KrynnEnergyFieldFocus2_Dec</Label>
    <String>Our crews have been using an aftermarket processing software which works the same as the one provided, but costs much less. We'll implement the change fleet wide, though probably won't investigate how an inefficient supplier won such a choice contract.</String>
  </StringTable>
  <StringTable>
    <Label>KrynnEnergyFieldFocus3_Dec</Label>
    <String>Our sensor equipment comes from the manufacturer with much unneeded extra gear that our crews were stripping off. If we do that fleet wide, we should see lighter sensors for everyone.</String>
  </StringTable>
  <StringTable>
    <Label>KrynnSubspaceSensors_Dec</Label>
    <String>Subspace is the reality underneath this one. Devoid of sentient life, and thus normally beneath the interest of those who spread the Way, our researchers note that by accessing it, our sensors should be able to see further.</String>

    <String>We've rooted out a very clever scam in our network of sensor parts suppliers, an organization which had been overbilling us for decades. Our sensors will now be cheaper, and the fiends will now be subject to a more detailed inquisition.</String>
  </StringTable>
  <StringTable>
    <Label>KrynnSensorMastery2_Dec</Label>
    <String>Our scientists are insisting we build their sensors with the suppliers of their choosing. Secular needs, such as the protection of the Secret Order's interests, have long prevented this. But the potential weight savings may now be too great to ignore.</String>

    <Label>KrynnTargetingAssistTech_Dec</Label>
    <String>In circumstances that require us to introduce the Path to an alien species via force, improved targeting and stealth systems will give our vessels the edge they need.</String>
  </StringTable>
  <StringTable>
    <Label>KrynnTargetingSupport_Dec</Label>
    <String>Our tactical sensor and evasion modules can now benefit an entire fleet of vessels. Cooperation will be necessary to maximize the effectiveness of this equipment, but that's an area the Krynn have always excelled in.</String>

    <Label>KrynnXenoArcheology_Dec</Label>
    <String>The Precursors were the first beings created by the shattering of the great crystal. Much of what they know is lost to us, but by analyzing their relics, we might peace together more of their history, shedding more light on the Way.</String>
  </StringTable>
  <StringTable>
    <Label>KrynnPrecursorStudies_Dec</Label>
    <String>Precursor technology seems to use a form of "dark energy" present both in the fragments of the long shattered crystal, as well as in all life. We still have much to learn to recreate this technology ourselves. But we must persist.</String>

  <StringTable>
    <Label>KrynnPrecursorRelicFocus1_Dec</Label>
    <String>By selecting our most pious researchers to work on Precursor artifacts, we can ensure not only faster research, but that their secrets aren't leaked out to the heretics that lurk in the shadows of our culture.</String>
  </StringTable>
  <StringTable>
    <Label>KrynnPrecursorRelicFocus2_Dec</Label>
    <String>If we highlight the parallels newly discovered Precursor artifacts have with the Way, we can make the wisdom of our path more apparent to those in the galaxy who still refuse to see it.</String>

  <StringTable>
    <Label>KrynnPrecursorRelicFocus3_Dec</Label>
    <String>Carefully released details of new Precursor artifacts, details that support the elements of the Path related to industry and enterprise, should increase the economic boost these artifacts seem to cause in our people.</String>
  </StringTable>
  <StringTable>
    <Label>KrynnPrecursorExploitation_Dec</Label>
    <String>Our Precursor researchers require very specialized equipment to handle the dark energy flows these relics require. Dedicated facilities with this equipment should increase our ability to research these artifacts.</String>
  </StringTable>
  <StringTable>
    <Label>KrynnPrecursorEngineering_Dec</Label>
    <String>We're now trying to recreate some of the Precursor's technology, using the same dark energy that powered their own incredible devices. All Krynn whose faith was wavering are finding it now. Even the heretics can see we're close to something big.</String>
  </StringTable>
  <StringTable>
    <Label>KrynnPrecursorUnderstanding_Dec</Label>
    <String>We understand completely. The Precursors, their corrupted creator, their downfall. We know all. Furthermore, we now see a new path to Ascension, a new route that the Path may use to lead us to the Way.</String>
  </StringTable>
  <StringTable>
    <Label>KrynnLifeSupport_Dec</Label>
    <String>Life support is a complicated challenge for us, considering the many species which make up the Krynn. But it's one we must tackle head on if we hope to introduce the Path to the unenlightened.</String>
  </StringTable>
  <StringTable>
    <Label>KrynnLifeSupportOptimization1_Dec</Label>
    <String>Blasphemers working in our shipyards have been sabotaging our life support systems, limiting our ship's ranges. We've fixed the damage, and will conduct a thorough inquisition to root out these villains.</String>
  </StringTable>
  <StringTable>
    <Label>KrynnLifeSupportOptimization2_Dec</Label>
    <String>A few days after we mentioned our problem with life support costs to one of our handlers in the Secret Order, our life support meal supplier voluntarily lowered their prices. Always nice when coincidences like that happen.</String>
  </StringTable>
  <StringTable>
    <Label>KrynnLifeSupportOptimization3_Dec</Label>
    <String>Reducing the mass of our air circulation and filtration systems should save weight our ships could use for other, more spiritual purposes.</String>
  </StringTable>
  <StringTable>
    <Label>KrynnSupportFieldGeneration_Dec</Label>
    <String>Support field systems use force fields to pipe nutrient-rich sludges to our crews. This will extend the range of our vessels and create a valuable sludge supply contract we can award to someone the Secret Order needs a favor from.</String>
  </StringTable>
  <StringTable>
    <Label>KrynnSupportFieldFocus1_Dec</Label>
    <String>More refined force fields with user-customizable controls have cut down on the mess and waste of our support field systems. Our sludge supplier may have preferred the old, wasteful ways, but now our ships can now travel much further.</String>
  </StringTable>
  <StringTable>
    <Label>KrynnSupportFieldFocus2_Dec</Label>
    <String>A new force field supplier promises a cheaper brand of emitter will work in our life support systems, so long as we promise not to ask many questions about where they came from. </String>
  </StringTable>
  <StringTable>
    <Label>KrynnSupportFieldFocus3_Dec</Label>
    <String>Less powerful force field emitters in our life support systems will save valuable weight. And our researchers note that we did not need that additional power, which was causing many of the messes in the first place.</String>
  </StringTable>
  <StringTable>
    <Label>KrynnPromethionSupportSystems_Dec</Label>
    <String>Promethion technology improves the injection and recycling capabilities of our life support, generating small quantities of new food directly from waste. Our crews are resistant to the idea, but a simple change to the Path will make it their moral duty.</String>
  </StringTable>
  <StringTable>
    <Label>KrynnLifeSupportMastery1_Dec</Label>
    <String>When appeals to their faith don't work, we can usually count on our suppliers cutting their prices after a few well timed visits from members of the Shadow Path. A shame for an arm or a leg to literally be at stake, but that's the way it has to be.</String>
  </StringTable>
  <StringTable>
    <Label>KrynnLifeSupportMastery2_Dec</Label>
    <String>Our researchers have devised a new type of Promethion field effecter which can be embedded directly in the nutrients, saving quite a bit of weight compared to their heavy, fixed counterparts. </String>
  </StringTable>
  <StringTable>
    <Label>KrynnLosslessSupportSystems_Dec</Label>
    <String>Lossless systems are an uncomfortable concept, the profit potential of waste a place where the shadows of Krynn culture have thrived. And yet we can't ignore the fact that long range ships will help spread the Way further than ever.</String>
  </StringTable>
  <StringTable>
    <Label>KrynnSupportFieldMastery_Dec</Label>
    <String>New technology will make it possible to offload partial life support requirements to different vessels in a fleet, or even a nearby starbase. A superb way to extend the range of our fleets, and keep a measure of control over less faithful crews.</String>
  </StringTable>
  <StringTable>
    <Label>KrynnExplorationExtention_Dec</Label>
    <String>Our Promethion support technology can now be used by our fleet-support vessels. These vessels control the fate and welfare of an entire fleet, and must be staffed by our least corruptible crews.</String>

  <StringTable>
    <Label>KrynnOrbitalManufacturing_Dec</Label>
    <String>If we move ship construction to orbital environments we should be able to build larger hulls. But we should first ensure the Secret Order has a chance to get their people in place, to limit the chances of corruption developing in this new industry.</String>
  </StringTable>
  <StringTable>
    <Label>KrynnOrbitalSpecialization1_Dec</Label>
    <String>By putting only the most loyal people in charge of our ship construction academies, we can ensure the workers going into the field aren't corrupted. This should result in higher manufacturing, and far less blasphemy.</String>
  </StringTable>
  <StringTable>
    <Label>KrynnOrbitalSpecialization3_Dec</Label>
    <String>By requiring fleet logistics officers to undertake extensive theological training we can ensure the workers that take those positions are influenced only by us. This should reduce corruption and thus increase our logistical capacity.</String>
  </StringTable>
  <StringTable>
    <Label>KrynnOrbitalSpecialization2_Dec</Label>
    <String>Lazy or unmotivated ship builders can easily restrict the amount of usable space on a ship with their sloth. If we motivate them properly, we can ensure our ships have the most usable space possible.</String>

    <Label>KrynnZeroGravityOptimization1_Dec</Label>
    <String>A new series of daily motivational sermons, focusing on the virtue of hard work, and the success our ships have spreading the Way, seems to have inspired our workers to build better, stronger ships.</String>
  </StringTable>
  <StringTable>
    <Label>KrynnZeroGravityOptimization3_Dec</Label>
    <String>As orbital construction becomes more complicated, the opportunity for graft and bribery blooms. We must monitor our managers and planners carefully, casting them out as blasphemers at the first sign of corruption.</String>
  </StringTable>
  <StringTable>
    <Label>KrynnZeroGravityOptimization2_Dec</Label>
    <String>One of our loyal ship workers realized that hollow structural elements can contain various smaller ship systems, saving space for other equipment. Properly designed, these have no impact to a ship's durability. His brilliance will be well rewarded.</String>
  </StringTable>

  <StringTable>
    <Label>KrynnOrbitalConstructionFocus1_Dec</Label>
    <String>It was a tremendous, almost miraculous insight to realize that molecular weaknesses in a hull could make it deformable in a controlled manner, increasing the resiliency of the entire hull. The researcher who came up with it is now a living legend.</String>
  </StringTable>
  <StringTable>
    <Label>KrynnOrbitalConstructionFocus3_Dec</Label>
    <String>We didn't dare trust our workers with heavy equipment when so many of them were potentially blasphemers. Now that the proper theological oversight is in place, this equipment should make construction faster and cheaper.</String>
  </StringTable>
  <StringTable>
    <Label>KrynnOrbitalConstructionFocus2_Dec</Label>
    <String>By rewarding workers who come up with space saving ideas with rewards, such as special dispensations from duties required by the Path, or even cash prizes, we've managed to improve the packing efficiency of all of our vessels.</String>
  </StringTable>
  <StringTable>
    <Label>KrynnMassiveScaleConstruction_Dec</Label>
    <String>Krynn vessels are now among the largest this galaxy has ever seen, rivaling even those of the Precursors. Few things will stop the primitive minds from learning the Way now.</String>

  </StringTable>
  <StringTable>
    <Label>KrynnHullStrengthening_Dec</Label>
    <String>The inner strength all Krynn possess, thanks to their commitment to the Path, is now more than a metaphor. We can embed strengthening fields in the hulls of our vessels, making them as resilient as we are.</String>
  </StringTable>
  <StringTable>
    <Label>KrynnHullRepairSystems_Dec</Label>
    <String>Metaphors continue to abound within our hulls. Our latest technology uses straightening fields to repair battle damage in our vessels, in the same way the Path can help restore our sense of purpose in the face of ignorance.</String>
  </StringTable>
  <StringTable>
    <Label>KrynnSelfHealingHulls_Dec</Label>
    <String>Nanobots are automations capable of repairing our ships and starbases, even during battle itself. The potential for criminal misuse of these is enormous, and they should only be deployed to our most loyal vessels.</String>
  </StringTable>
  <StringTable>
    <Label>KrynnCarrierTech_Dec</Label>
    <String>Carrier combat will expose selected Krynn to excessive danger while protecting those who remain on our capital ships. So long as the pilots understand the risk, we shall allow this, while continuing to make all efforts to secure their future salvation.</String>
  </StringTable>
  <StringTable>
    <Label>KrynnHighCapacityCarriers_Dec</Label>
    <String>New, compact fighters, along with our growing cabal of pilots who don't mind cramped quarters, will allow us to begin deploying high capacity carrier modules.</String>

  <StringTable>
    <Label>KrynnLogisticalOptimization1_Dec</Label>
    <String>Relativistic travel creates a bookkeeping nightmare which mere faith does little to address. To counter this, we've developed a new system of record keeping, which should improve our logistical capacity.</String>
  </StringTable>
  <StringTable>
    <Label>KrynnLogisticalOptimization2_Dec</Label>
    <String>Mines will always be a breeding ground for corruption; the Krynn who choose to work there are almost always beyond salvation. Still, with the right management, we can contain the worst of the fraud and graft, indirectly increasing mining output.</String>
  </StringTable>
  <StringTable>
    <Label>KrynnLogisticalOptimization3_Dec</Label>
    <String>Shipyards are incredibly complicated operations, filled with people and groups that are all potential sources for inefficiency and corruption. Ensuring our shipyard managers are of the highest moral character should cut down on the waste somewhat.</String>
  </StringTable>
  <StringTable>
    <Label>KrynnFleetLogisticsTech_Dec</Label>
    <String>Due to the many races which all achieved sentience on our home world, the Krynn cooperate like few other civilizations. So long as corruption can remain in check, our fleet logistical operations will remain the envy of the galaxy.</String>
  </StringTable>
  <StringTable>
    <Label>KrynnDeepSpaceLogistics_Dec</Label>
    <String>As our fleets grow, so does the challenge of supplying them. Although our starbases are staffed by faithful and honest Krynn, segments of the supply chain remain quite corruptible. We must redouble our efforts to ensure out fleets stay supplied.</String>
  </StringTable>

    <Label>KrynnGalacticLogistics_Dec</Label>
    <String>Logistics is now perhaps the most respected career path within our civilization, all of its priests renowned for their piousness and incorruptible character, only responding to our (and the Secret Order's) bidding.</String>

    <Label>KrynnHighEfficiencyMining_Dec</Label>
    <String>After providing them the right training (and body armor) we've begun deploying loyal clerics to manage our mines, to both bring some measure of salvation to the scum that work there, and increase the output of goods which ultimately reach us.</String>

  <StringTable>
    <Label>KrynnResourceExtraction_Dec</Label>
    <String>Replacing our miners with resource extraction probes not only cuts back on the opportunity for theft, it will allow us to extract minerals found in concentrations once thought too low to be worth our time.</String>

    <Label>KrynnWeaponsSystemsTech_Dec</Label>
    <String>Researchers sworn to the Shadow Path have a certain knack for weapon design, and have developed basic weapons for our ships. A valuable group, although due to their flexible morals, they must be segregated from our regular research communities.</String>
  </StringTable>
  <StringTable>
    <Label>KrynnBeamWeapons_Dec</Label>
    <String>There is something pure, even beautiful about beam weapons. Even an initiate on the Path can see the allegory in the manner they illuminate with such fury. And our new beam weapons shall be even more illuminating.</String>

  </StringTable>
  <StringTable>
    <Label>KrynnHighEnergyFocus1_Dec</Label>
    <String>By using intelligent (but non-sentient) crystal growing processes, we can create focusing crystals capable of much higher energy throughputs, making all our beam weapons a bit stronger.</String>
  </StringTable>
  <StringTable>
    <Label>KrynnHighEnergyFocus2_Dec</Label>
    <String>Our weapons researchers have been instructed to take some of the mysticism out of the manufacture of beam weapons. Shorter, less elaborate ritual blessings, and more automation should reduce the cost of each unit.</String>
  </StringTable>
  <StringTable>
    <Label>KrynnHighEnergyFocus3_Dec</Label>
    <String>Reducing the mass of our beam weapons' cooling equipment is a neat trick which our weapons researchers refuse to reveal how they accomplished. Some sort of industrial espionage seems likely, but we're not going to ask any questions.</String>
  </StringTable>
  <StringTable>
    <Label>KrynnPlasmaProjection_Dec</Label>

  <StringTable>
    <Label>KrynnBeamWeaponMastery1_Dec</Label>
    <String>One of our suppliers for plasma containment fields was not giving us the best possible price. Then after an unfortunate accident, he suddenly saw the error of his ways, lowering his prices and apologizing for his sins.</String>
  </StringTable>
  <StringTable>
    <Label>KrynnBeamWeaponMastery2_Dec</Label>
    <String>Our beam weapons are now as mass efficient as this reality will allow us. To get around these limits, we will have to ascend to a higher plane. But by that point, we'll no longer need weapons at all.</String>
  </StringTable>
  <StringTable>
    <Label>KrynnEnergyPhasing_Dec</Label>
    <String>Phaser particles are the most confusing thing our weapons researchers have invented yet. This feels dangerously close to blasphemy, twisting the physical world in this way. But the Way must be spread.</String>

  <StringTable>
    <Label>KrynnBeamWeaponAugmentation_Dec</Label>
    <String>Using a new ritual based on force fields, our weapons researchers have found a way to augment the beam output of an entire fleet. A blessed development, taking advantage of our people's natural affinity for cooperation.</String>
  </StringTable>

  <StringTable>
    <Label>KrynnMissileOptimization2_Dec</Label>
    <String>The Secret Order has always thought highly of missiles due to their cost effectiveness, allowing more resources to remain unspent and within their control. And now our missiles are a little bit cheaper again.</String>
  </StringTable>
  <StringTable>
    <Label>KrynnMissileOptimization3_Dec</Label>

  <StringTable>
    <Label>KrynnPhotonicWarheads_Dec</Label>
    <String>Photonic warheads use a shell of photons to pierce the shields and armor of their target, making them more effective. A suiting metaphor for a well worked argument that slips pasts an unbeliever's defenses, finally opening their eyes.</String>
  </StringTable>
  <StringTable>
    <Label>KrynnPayloadMastery1_Dec</Label>
    <String>Missile manufacturing has finally been brought entirely under the control of suppliers preferred by the Secret Order. We should see reduced costs for all of our missiles.</String>

  <StringTable>
    <Label>KrynnKineticOptimization3_Dec</Label>
    <String>Some strange new winding of the electromagnetic coils results in lighter, more compact coils that are just as effective as before. Similar to the way the Shadow Path takes its own strange and winding path to achieve the same ends as us.</String>
  </StringTable>
  <StringTable>
    <Label>KrynnPulseCannonTech_Dec</Label>
    <String>Particles can be more effective than projectiles if we fire many of them at the same time. These pulse cannons have similar tactical characteristics as other kinetic weapons, so we won't have to update the components of the Path relevant to ship command.</String>
